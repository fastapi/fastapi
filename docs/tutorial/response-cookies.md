## Use a `Response` parameter

You can declare a parameter of type `Response` in your *path operation function*, the same way you can declare a `Request` parameter.

And then you can set headers in that *temporal* response object.

```Python hl_lines="2 8 9"
{!./src/response_cookies/tutorial002.py!}
```

And then you can return any object you need, as you normally would (a `dict`, a database model, etc).

And if you declared a `response_model`, it will still be used to filter and convert the object you returned.

**FastAPI** will use that *temporal* response to extract the cookies (also headers and status code), and will put them in the final response that contains the value you returned, filtered by any `response_model`.

You can also declare the `Response` parameter in dependencies, and set cookies (and headers) in them.

## Return a `Response` directly

You can also create cookies when returning a `Response` directly in your code.

To do that, you can create a response as described in <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-directly/" target="_blank">Return a Response directly</a>.

Then set Cookies in it, and then return it:

```Python hl_lines="10 11 12"
{!./src/response_cookies/tutorial001.py!}
```

!!! tip
    Have in mind that if you return a response directly instead of using the `Response` parameter, FastAPI will return it directly.

    So, you will have to make sure your data is of the correct type. E.g. it is compatible with JSON, if you are returning a `JSONResponse`.

    And also that you are not sending any data that should have been filtered by a `response_model`.
