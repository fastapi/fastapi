# Deploy FastAPI on Cloud Providers { #deploy-fastapi-on-cloud-providers }

You can use virtually **any cloud provider** to deploy your FastAPI application.

In most of the cases, the main cloud providers have guides to deploy FastAPI with them.

## FastAPI Cloud { #fastapi-cloud }

**<a href="https://fastapicloud.com" class="external-link" target="_blank">FastAPI Cloud</a>** is built by the same author and team behind **FastAPI**.

It streamlines the process of **building**, **deploying**, and **accessing** an API with minimal effort.

It brings the same **developer experience** of building apps with FastAPI to **deploying** them to the cloud. 🎉

FastAPI Cloud is the primary sponsor and funding provider for the *FastAPI and friends* open source projects. ✨
