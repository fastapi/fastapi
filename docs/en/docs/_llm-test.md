# LLM test { #llm-test }

This document tests if the <abbr title="Large Language Model">LLM</abbr> understands the instructions given in the general prompt in `scripts/translate.py` and those in the language specific prompt `docs/{language code}/llm-prompt.md`, (which are appended to the instructions in the general prompt).

Use as follows:

* Do a fresh translation of this document into the desired target language.
* Check if things are mostly okay.
* If some things are not okay, but are fixable by improving the English document or the general or the language specific prompt, do that.
* Then manually fix the remaining issues in the translation, so that it is a good translation.
* Retranslate using the existing, good translation. The ideal result should be that the LLM makes no changes at all. That would mean that the general prompt and the language prompt are as good as they can be (Plot twist: It will usually make a few seemingly random changes, the reason is probably that <a href="https://doublespeak.chat/#/handbook#deterministic-output" class="external-link" target="_blank">LLMs are not deterministic algorithms</a>).

The idea is, that, when working on a translation for a language (assumed one is able to run `scripts/translate.py`), to include examples of found special cases here (not a detailed list, just examples for such special cases) and test with this document, rather than testing with every other single document, translating it multiple times, which costs a few cents per translation. Also, by adding such special cases here, other translation projects will also become aware of such special cases.

## Code snippets { #code-snippets}

This is a code snippet: `foo`. And this is another code snippet: `bar`. And another one: `baz quux`.

## Quotes { #quotes }

Yesterday, my friend wrote: "If you spell incorrectly correctly, you have spelled it incorrectly". To which I answered: "Correct, but 'incorrectly' is incorrectly not '"incorrectly"'".

## Quotes in code snippets { #quotes-in-code-snippets}

`pip install "foo[bar]"`

Examples for string literals in code snippets: `"this"`, `'that'`.

A difficult example for string literals in code snippets: `f"I like {'oranges' if orange else "apples"}"`

Hardcore: `Yesterday my friend wrote: "If you spell incorrectly correctly you have spelled it incorrectly". To which I answered: "Correct, but 'incorrectly' is incorrectly not '"incorrectly"'!"`

## code blocks { #code-blocks }

A Bash code example...

```bash
# Print a greeting to the universe
echo "Hello universe"
```

...and a console code example...

```console
$ <font color="#4E9A06">fastapi</font> run <u style="text-decoration-style:solid">main.py</u>
<span style="background-color:#009485"><font color="#D3D7CF"> FastAPI </font></span>  Starting server
        Searching for package file structure
```

...and another console code example...

```console
// Create a directory "Code"
$ mkdir code
// Switch into that directory
$ cd code
```

...and a Python code example...

```Python
wont_work()  # This won't work ðŸ˜±
works(foo="bar")  # This works ðŸŽ‰
```

...and that's it.
