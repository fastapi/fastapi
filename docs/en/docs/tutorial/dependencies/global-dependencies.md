# Global Dependencies

For some types of applications you might want to add dependencies to the whole application.

Similar to the way you can [add `dependencies` to the *path operation decorators*](dependencies-in-path-operation-decorators.md){.internal-link target=_blank}, you can add them to the `FastAPI` application.

In that case, they will be applied to all the *path operations* in the application:

=== "Python 3.9+"

    ```Python hl_lines="16"
    {!> ../../../docs_src/dependencies/tutorial012_an_py39.py!}
    ```

=== "Python 3.8+"

    ```Python hl_lines="16"
    {!> ../../../docs_src/dependencies/tutorial012_an.py!}
    ```

=== "Python 3.8 non-Annotated"

    !!! tip
        Prefer to use the `Annotated` version if possible.

    ```Python hl_lines="15"
    {!> ../../../docs_src/dependencies/tutorial012.py!}
    ```

And all the ideas in the section about [adding `dependencies` to the *path operation decorators*](dependencies-in-path-operation-decorators.md){.internal-link target=_blank} still apply, but in this case, to all of the *path operations* in the app.

## Dependencies for groups of *path operations*

Later, when reading about how to structure bigger applications ([Bigger Applications - Multiple Files](../../tutorial/bigger-applications.md){.internal-link target=_blank}), possibly with multiple files, you will learn how to declare a single `dependencies` parameter for a group of *path operations*.
