PR [#4655](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/4655) by [@tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo) based on original PR [#4626](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/4626) by [@hanxiao](https://github.com/hanxiao).

## 0.75.0

### Features

* ✨ Add support for custom `generate_unique_id_function` and docs for generating clients. New docs: [Advanced - Generate Clients](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/generate-clients/). PR [#4650](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/4650) by [@tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo).

## 0.74.1

## 0.74.0

### Breaking Changes

* ✨ Update internal `AsyncExitStack` to fix context for dependencies with `yield`. PR [#4575](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/4575) by [@tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo).

Dependencies with `yield` can now catch `HTTPException` and custom exceptions. For example:

```Python
async def get_database():
    with Session() as session:
        try:
            yield session
        except HTTPException:
            session.rollback()
            raise
        finally:
            session.close()
```

After the dependency with `yield` handles the exception (or not) the exception is raised again. So that any exception handlers can catch it, or ultimately the default internal `ServerErrorMiddleware`.

If you depended on exceptions not being received by dependencies with `yield`, and receiving an exception breaks the code after `yield`, you can use a block with `try` and `finally`:

```Python
async def do_something():
    try:
        yield something
    finally:
        some_cleanup()
```

...that way the `finally` block is run regardless of any exception that might happen.

### Features

* The same PR [#4575](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/4575) from above also fixes the `contextvars` context for the code before and after `yield`. This was the main objective of that PR.

This means that now, if you set a value in a context variable before `yield`, the value would still be available after `yield` (as you would intuitively expect). And it also means that you can reset the context variable with a token afterwards.

For example, this works correctly now:

```Python
from contextvars import ContextVar
from typing import Any, Dict, Optional


legacy_request_state_context_var: ContextVar[Optional[Dict[str, Any]]] = ContextVar(
    "legacy_request_state_context_var", default=None
)

async def set_up_request_state_dependency():
    request_state = {"user": "deadpond"}
    contextvar_token = legacy_request_state_context_var.set(request_state)
    yield request_state
    legacy_request_state_context_var.reset(contextvar_token)
```

...before this change it would raise an error when resetting the context variable, because the `contextvars` context was different, because of the way it was implemented.

**Note**: You probably don't need `contextvars`, and you should probably avoid using them. But they are powerful and useful in some advanced scenarios, for example, migrating from code that used Flask's `g` semi-global variable.

**Technical Details**: If you want to know more of the technical details you can check out the PR description [#4575](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/4575).

## 0.70.0

This release just upgrades Starlette to the latest version, `0.16.0`, which includes several bug fixes and some small breaking changes.

These last **three consecutive releases** are independent so that you can **migrate gradually**:

* First to FastAPI `0.68.2`, with no breaking changes, but upgrading all the sub-dependencies.
* Next to FastAPI `0.69.0`, which upgrades Starlette to `0.15.0`, with AnyIO support, and a higher chance of having breaking changes in your code.
* Finally to FastAPI `0.70.0`, just upgrading Starlette to the latest version `0.16.0` with additional bug fixes.

This way, in case there was a breaking change for your code in one of the releases, you can still benefit from the previous upgrades. ✨

### Breaking Changes - Upgrade

* ⬆️ Upgrade Starlette to 0.16.0. PR [#4016](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/4016) by [@tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo).

Also upgrades the ranges of optional dependencies:

* `"jinja2 >=2.11.2,<4.0.0"`
* `"itsdangerous >=1.1.0,<3.0.0"`

## 0.69.0

### Breaking Changes - Upgrade

This release adds support for [Trio](https://trio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). ✨

It upgrades the version of Starlette to `0.15.0`, now based on [AnyIO](https://anyio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), and the internal async components in **FastAPI** are now based on AnyIO as well, making it compatible with both **asyncio** and **Trio**.

You can read the docs about running [FastAPI with Trio using Hypercorn](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/deployment/manually/#hypercorn-with-trio).

This release also removes `graphene` as an optional dependency for GraphQL. If you need to work with GraphQL, the recommended library now is [Strawberry](https://strawberry.rocks/). You can read the new [FastAPI with GraphQL docs](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/graphql/).

## 0.68.2

This release has **no breaking changes**. 🎉

It upgrades the version ranges of sub-dependencies to allow applications using FastAPI to easily upgrade them.

Soon there will be a new FastAPI release upgrading Starlette to take advantage of recent improvements, but as that has a higher chance of having breaking changes, it will be in a separate release.

## 0.65.2

### Security fixes

* 🔒 Check Content-Type request header before assuming JSON. Initial PR [#2118](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/2118) by [@patrickkwang](https://github.com/patrickkwang).

This change fixes a [CSRF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) security vulnerability when using cookies for authentication in path operations with JSON payloads sent by browsers.

In versions lower than `0.65.2`, FastAPI would try to read the request payload as JSON even if the `content-type` header sent was not set to `application/json` or a compatible JSON media type (e.g. `application/geo+json`).

So, a request with a content type of `text/plain` containing JSON data would be accepted and the JSON data would be extracted.

But requests with content type `text/plain` are exempt from [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) preflights, for being considered [Simple requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#simple_requests). So, the browser would execute them right away including cookies, and the text content could be a JSON string that would be parsed and accepted by the FastAPI application.

See [CVE-2021-32677](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/security/advisories/GHSA-8h2j-cgx8-6xv7) for more details.

## 0.62.0

### Features

* ✨ Add support for shared/top-level parameters (dependencies, tags, etc). PR [#2434](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/2434) by [@tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo).

Up to now, for several options, the only way to apply them to a group of *path operations* was in `include_router`. That works well, but the call to `app.include_router()` or `router.include_router()` is normally done in another file.

That means that, for example, to apply authentication to all the *path operations* in a router it would end up being done in a different file, instead of keeping related logic together.

Setting options in `include_router` still makes sense in some cases, for example, to override or increase configurations from a third party router included in an app. But in a router that is part of a bigger application, it would probably make more sense to add those settings when creating the `APIRouter`.

**In `FastAPI`**

This allows setting the (mostly new) parameters (additionally to the already existing parameters):

* `default_response_class`: updated to handle defaults in `APIRouter` and `include_router`.
* `dependencies`: to include ✨ top-level dependencies ✨ that apply to the whole application. E.g. to add global authentication.
* `callbacks`: OpenAPI callbacks that apply to all the *path operations*.
* `deprecated`: to mark all the *path operations* as deprecated. 🤷
* `include_in_schema`: to allow excluding all the *path operations* from the OpenAPI schema.
* `responses`: OpenAPI responses that apply to all the *path operations*.

For example:

```Python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends


async def some_dependency():
    return


app = FastAPI(dependencies=[Depends(some_dependency)])
```

**In `APIRouter`**

This allows setting the (mostly new) parameters (additionally to the already existing parameters):

* `default_response_class`: updated to handle defaults in `APIRouter` and `include_router`. For example, it's not needed to set it explicitly when [creating callbacks](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/openapi-callbacks/).
* `dependencies`: to include ✨ router-level dependencies ✨ that apply to all the *path operations* in a router. Up to now, this was only possible with `include_router`.
* `callbacks`: OpenAPI callbacks that apply to all the *path operations* in this router.
* `deprecated`: to mark all the *path operations* in a router as deprecated.
* `include_in_schema`: to allow excluding all the *path operations* in a router from the OpenAPI schema.
* `responses`: OpenAPI responses that apply to all the *path operations* in a router.
* `prefix`: to set the path prefix for a router. Up to now, this was only possible when calling `include_router`.
* `tags`: OpenAPI tags to apply to all the *path operations* in this router.

For example:

```Python
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends


async def some_dependency():
    return


router = APIRouter(prefix="/users", dependencies=[Depends(some_dependency)])
```

**In `include_router`**

Most of these settings are now supported in `APIRouter`, which normally lives closer to the related code, so it is recommended to use `APIRouter` when possible.

But `include_router` is still useful to, for example, adding options (like `dependencies`, `prefix`, and `tags`) when including a third party router, or a generic router that is shared between several projects.

This PR allows setting the (mostly new) parameters (additionally to the already existing parameters):

* `default_response_class`: updated to handle defaults in `APIRouter` and `FastAPI`.
* `deprecated`: to mark all the *path operations* in a router as deprecated in OpenAPI.
* `include_in_schema`: to allow disabling all the *path operations* from showing in the OpenAPI schema.
* `callbacks`: OpenAPI callbacks that apply to all the *path operations* in this router.

Note: all the previous parameters are still there, so it's still possible to declare `dependencies` in `include_router`.

### Breaking Changes

* PR [#2434](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/2434) includes several improvements that shouldn't affect normal use cases, but could affect in advanced scenarios:
    * If you are testing the generated OpenAPI (you shouldn't, FastAPI already tests it extensively for you): the order for `tags` in `include_router` and *path operations* was updated for consistency, but it's a simple order change.
    * If you have advanced custom logic to access each route's `route.response_class`, or the `router.default_response_class`, or the `app.default_response_class`: the default value for `response_class` in `APIRoute` and for `default_response_class` in `APIRouter` and `FastAPI` is now a `DefaultPlaceholder` used internally to handle and solve default values and overrides. The actual response class inside the `DefaultPlaceholder` is available at `route.response_class.value`.

## 0.61.1

### Fixes

* Fix issues using `jsonable_encoder` with SQLAlchemy models directly. PR [#1987](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/1987).

### Docs

* Fix typo in NoSQL docs. PR [#1980](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/1980) by [@facundojmaero](https://github.com/facundojmaero).

### Translations

* Add translation for [main page to Japanese](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/ja/) PR [#1571](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/1571) by [@ryuckel](https://github.com/ryuckel).
* Initialize French translations. PR [#1975](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/1975) by [@JulianMaurin-BM](https://github.com/JulianMaurin-BM).

### Internal

* Improve docs maintainability by updating `hl_lines` syntax to use ranges. PR [#1863](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/1863) by [@la-mar](https://github.com/la-mar).

## 0.61.0

### Features

* Add support for injecting `HTTPConnection` (as `Request` and `WebSocket`). Useful for sharing app state in dependencies. PR [#1827](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/1827) by [@nsidnev](https://github.com/nsidnev).
* Export `WebSocketDisconnect` and add example handling WebSocket disconnections to docs. PR [#1822](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/1822) by [@rkbeatss](https://github.com/rkbeatss).

### Breaking Changes

* Require Pydantic > `1.0.0`.
    * Remove support for deprecated Pydantic `0.32.2`. This improves maintainability and allows new features.
    * In `FastAPI` and `APIRouter`:
        * Remove *path operation decorators* related/deprecated parameter `response_model_skip_defaults` (use `response_model_exclude_unset` instead).
        * Change *path operation decorators* parameter default for `response_model_exclude` from `set()` to `None` (as is in Pydantic).
    * In `encoders.jsonable_encoder`:
        * Remove deprecated `skip_defaults`, use instead `exclude_unset`.
        * Set default of `exclude` from `set()` to `None` (as is in Pydantic).
    * PR [#1862](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/1862).
* In `encoders.jsonable_encoder` remove parameter `sqlalchemy_safe`.
    * It was an early hack to allow returning SQLAlchemy models, but it was never documented, and the recommended way is using Pydantic's `orm_mode` as described in the tutorial: [SQL (Relational) Databases](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/sql-databases/).
    * PR [#1864](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/1864).

### Docs

* Add link to the course by TestDriven.io: [Test-Driven Development with FastAPI and Docker](https://testdriven.io/courses/tdd-fastapi/). PR [#1860](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/1860).
* Fix empty log message in docs example about handling errors. PR [#1815](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/1815) by [@manlix](https://github.com/manlix).

### Internal

* Add Flake8 linting. Original PR [#1774](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/1774) by [@MashhadiNima](https://github.com/MashhadiNima).
* Disable Gitter bot, as it's currently broken, and Gitter's response doesn't show the problem. PR [#1853](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/1853).

* Add docs about [Async Tests](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/async-tests/). PR [#1619](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/1619) by [@empicano](https://github.com/empicano).
* Raise an exception when using form data (`Form`, `File`) without having `python-multipart` installed.
    * Up to now the application would run, and raise an exception only when receiving a request with form data, the new behavior, raising early, will prevent from deploying applications with broken dependencies.
    * It also detects if the correct package `python-multipart` is installed instead of the incorrect `multipart` (both importable as `multipart`).
    * PR [#1851](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/1851) based on original PR [#1627](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/1627) by [@chrisngyn](https://github.com/chrisngyn), [@YKo20010](https://github.com/YKo20010), [@kx-chen](https://github.com/kx-chen).

## 0.42.0

* Add dependencies with `yield`, a.k.a. exit steps, context managers, cleanup, teardown, ...
    * This allows adding extra code after a dependency is done. It can be used, for example, to close database connections.
    * Dependencies with `yield` can be normal or `async`, **FastAPI** will run normal dependencies in a threadpool.
    * They can be combined with normal dependencies.
    * It's possible to have arbitrary trees/levels of dependencies with `yield` and exit steps are handled in the correct order automatically.
    * It works by default in Python 3.7 or above. For Python 3.6, it requires the extra backport dependencies:
        * `async-exit-stack`
        * `async-generator`
    * New docs at [Dependencies with `yield`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/dependencies-with-yield/).

    * Add `State` to FastAPI apps at `app.state`.
    * PR [#593](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/593).
* Improve handling of custom classes for `Request`s and `APIRoute`s.
    * This helps to more easily solve use cases like:
        * Reading a body before and/or after a request (equivalent to a middleware).
        * Run middleware-like code only for a subset of *path operations*.
        * Process a request before passing it to a *path operation function*. E.g. decompressing, deserializing, etc.
        * Processing a response after being generated by *path operation functions* but before returning it. E.g. adding custom headers, logging, adding extra metadata.
    * New docs section: [Custom Request and APIRoute class](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/custom-request-and-route/).
    * PR [#589](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/589) by [@dmontagu](https://github.com/dmontagu).

## 0.39.0

* Allow path parameters to have default values (e.g. `None`) and discard them instead of raising an error.
    * This allows declaring a parameter like `user_id: str = None` that can be taken from a query parameter, but the same *path operation* can be included in a router with a path `/users/{user_id}`, in which case will be taken from the path and will be required.
    * PR [#464](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/464) by [@jonathanunderwood](https://github.com/jonathanunderwood).
* Add support for setting a `default_response_class` in the `FastAPI` instance or in `include_router`. Initial PR [#467](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/467) by [@toppk](https://github.com/toppk).

* Allow having empty paths in *path operations* used with `include_router` and a `prefix`.
    * This allows having a router for `/cats` and all its *path operations*, while having one of them for `/cats`.
    * Now it doesn't have to be only `/cats/` (with a trailing slash).
    * To use it, declare the path in the *path operation* as the empty string (`""`).
    * PR [#415](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/415) by [@vitalik](https://github.com/vitalik).
* Fix mypy error after merging PR #415. PR [#462](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/462).

* Add note to docs: [Include the same router multiple times with different `prefix`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/bigger-applications/#include-the-same-router-multiple-times-with-different-prefix). PR [#348](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/348).

* Fix OpenAPI/JSON Schema generation for two functions with the same name (in different modules) with the same composite bodies.
    * Composite bodies' IDs are now based on path, not only on route name, as the auto-generated name uses the function names, that can be duplicated in different modules.
    * The same new ID generation applies to response models.
    * This also changes the generated title for those models.
    * Only composite bodies and response models are affected because those are generated dynamically, they don't have a module (a Python file).
    * This also adds the possibility of using `.include_router()` with the same `APIRouter` *multiple*  times, with different prefixes, e.g. `/api/v2` and `/api/latest`, and it will now work correctly.
    * PR [#347](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/347).

    * Updated documentation about SQL with SQLAlchemy, using Pydantic models with ORM mode, SQLAlchemy models with relations, separation of files, simplification of code and other changes. New docs: [SQL (Relational) Databases](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/sql-databases/).
    * The new support for ORM mode fixes issues/adds features related to ORMs with lazy-loading, hybrid properties, dynamic/getters (using `@property` decorators) and several other use cases.
    * This applies to ORMs like SQLAlchemy, Peewee, Tortoise ORM, GINO ORM and virtually any other.
    * If your *path operations* return an arbitrary object with attributes (e.g. `my_item.name` instead of `my_item["name"]`) AND you use a `response_model`, make sure to update the Pydantic models with `orm_mode = True` as described in the docs (link above).
    * New documentation about receiving plain `dict`s as request bodies: [Bodies of arbitrary `dict`s](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/body-nested-models/#bodies-of-arbitrary-dicts).
    * New documentation about returning arbitrary `dict`s in responses: [Response with arbitrary `dict`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/extra-models/#response-with-arbitrary-dict).
    * **Technical Details**:
        * When declaring a `response_model` it is used directly to generate the response content, from whatever was returned from the *path operation function*.
        * Before this, the return content was first passed through `jsonable_encoder` to ensure it was a "jsonable" object, like a `dict`, instead of an arbitrary object with attributes (like an ORM model). That's why you should make sure to update your Pydantic models for objects with attributes to use `orm_mode = True`.
        * If you don't have a `response_model`, the return object will still be passed through `jsonable_encoder` first.
        * When a `response_model` is declared, the same `response_model` type declaration won't be used as is, it will be "cloned" to create an new one (a cloned Pydantic `Field` with all the submodels cloned as well).
        * This avoids/fixes a potential security issue: as the returned object is passed directly to Pydantic, if the returned object was a subclass of the `response_model` (e.g. you return a `UserInDB` that inherits from `User` but contains extra fields, like `hashed_password`, and `User` is used in the `response_model`), it would still pass the validation (because `UserInDB` is a subclass of `User`) and the object would be returned as-is, including the `hashed_password`. To fix this, the declared `response_model` is cloned, if it is a Pydantic model class (or contains Pydantic model classes in it, e.g. in a `List[Item]`), the Pydantic model class(es) will be a different one (the "cloned" one). So, an object that is a subclass won't simply pass the validation and returned as-is, because it is no longer a sub-class of the cloned `response_model`. Instead, a new Pydantic model object will be created with the contents of the returned object. So, it will be a new object (made with the data from the returned one), and will be filtered by the cloned `response_model`, containing only the declared fields as normally.

## 0.29.0

* Add support for declaring a `Response` parameter:
    * This allows declaring:
        * [Response Cookies](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/response-cookies/).
        * [Response Headers](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/response-headers/).
        * An HTTP Status Code different than the default: [Response - Change Status Code](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/response-change-status-code/).

    * Update attribution to Hug, for inspiring the `response` parameter pattern.
    * PR [#294](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/294).

## 0.28.0

* Implement dependency cache per request.
    * This avoids calling each dependency multiple times for the same request.
    * This is useful while calling external services, performing costly computation, etc.
    * This also means that if a dependency was declared as a *path operation decorator* dependency, possibly at the router level (with `.include_router()`) and then it is declared again in a specific *path operation*, the dependency will be called only once.
    * The cache can be disabled per dependency declaration, using `use_cache=False` as in `Depends(your_dependency, use_cache=False)`.
    * Updated docs at: [Using the same dependency multiple times](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/sub-dependencies/#using-the-same-dependency-multiple-times).
    * PR [#292](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/292).

## 0.23.0

* Upgrade the compatible version of Starlette to `0.12.0`.
    * This includes support for ASGI 3 (the latest version of the standard).
    * It's now possible to use [Starlette's `StreamingResponse`](https://www.starlette.io/responses/#streamingresponse) with iterators, like [file-like](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-file-like-object) objects (as those returned by `open()`).
    * It's now possible to use the low level utility `iterate_in_threadpool` from `starlette.concurrency` (for advanced scenarios).
    * PR [#243](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/243).

* Add OAuth2 redirect page for Swagger UI. This allows having delegated authentication in the Swagger UI docs. For this to work, you need to add `{your_origin}/docs/oauth2-redirect` to the allowed callbacks in your OAuth2 provider (in Auth0, Facebook, Google, etc).
    * For example, during development, it could be `http://localhost:8000/docs/oauth2-redirect`.
    * Have in mind that this callback URL is independent of whichever one is used by your frontend. You might also have another callback at `https://yourdomain.com/login/callback`.
    * This is only to allow delegated authentication in the API docs with Swagger UI.
    * PR [#198](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/198) by [@steinitzu](https://github.com/steinitzu).

* Make Swagger UI and ReDoc URLs parameterizable, allowing to host and serve local versions of them and have offline docs. PR [#112](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/112) by [@euri10](https://github.com/euri10).

## 0.22.0

* Add support for `dependencies` parameter:
    * A parameter in *path operation decorators*, for dependencies that should be executed but the return value is not important or not used in the *path operation function*.
    * A parameter in the `.include_router()` method of FastAPI applications and routers, to include dependencies that should be executed in each *path operation* in a router.
        * This is useful, for example, to require authentication or permissions in specific group of *path operations*.
        * Different `dependencies` can be applied to different routers.
    * These `dependencies` are run before the normal parameter dependencies. And normal dependencies are run too. They can be combined.
    * Dependencies declared in a router are executed first, then the ones defined in *path operation decorators*, and then the ones declared in normal parameters. They are all combined and executed.
    * All this also supports using `Security` with `scopes` in those `dependencies` parameters, for more advanced OAuth 2.0 security scenarios with scopes.
    * New documentation about [dependencies in *path operation decorators*](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/dependencies-in-path-operation-decorators/).
    * New documentation about [dependencies in the `include_router()` method](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/bigger-applications/#include-an-apirouter-with-a-prefix-tags-responses-and-dependencies).

* Fix OpenAPI documentation of Starlette URL convertors. Specially useful when using `path` convertors, to take a whole path as a parameter, like `/some/url/{p:path}`. PR [#234](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/234) by [@euri10](https://github.com/euri10).

* Make default parameter utilities exported from `fastapi` be functions instead of classes (the new functions return instances of those classes). To be able to override the return types and fix `mypy` errors in FastAPI's users' code. Applies to `Path`, `Query`, `Header`, `Cookie`, `Body`, `Form`, `File`, `Depends`, and `Security`.
