You can "watch" FastAPI in GitHub (clicking the "watch" button at the top right): <a href="https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi" class="external-link" target="_blank">https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi</a>. üëÄ

## Join the chat

<a href="https://gitter.im/tiangolo/fastapi?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge" target="_blank">
    <img src="https://badges.gitter.im/tiangolo/fastapi.svg" alt="Join the chat at https://gitter.im/tiangolo/fastapi">
</a>

Join the chat on Gitter: <a href="https://gitter.im/tiangolo/fastapi" class="external-link" target="_blank">https://gitter.im/tiangolo/fastapi</a>.

There you can have quick conversations with others, help others, share ideas, etc.

But have in mind that as it allows more "free conversation", it's easy to ask questions that are too general and more difficult to answer, so, you might not receive answers.

In GitHub issues the template will guide to to write the right question so that you can more easily get a good answer, or even solve the problem yourself even before asking. And in GitHub I can make sure I always answer everything, even if it takes some time. I can't personally do that with the Gitter chat. üòÖ

Conversations in Gitter are also not as easily searchable as in GitHub, so questions and answers might get lost in the conversation.

On the other side, there's more than 1000 people in the chat, so there's a high chance you'll find someone to talk to there, almost all the time. üòÑ

## Sponsor the author

You can also financially support the author (me) through <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/tiangolo" class="external-link" target="_blank">GitHub sponsors</a>.

There you could buy me a coffee ‚òïÔ∏è to say thanks üòÑ.

## Sponsor the tools that power FastAPI

As you have seen in the documentation, FastAPI stands on the shoulders of giants, Starlette and Pydantic.

You can also sponsor:

* <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/samuelcolvin" class="external-link" target="_blank">Samuel Colvin (Pydantic)</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/encode" class="external-link" target="_blank">Encode (Starlette, Uvicorn)</a>

Thanks! üöÄ
