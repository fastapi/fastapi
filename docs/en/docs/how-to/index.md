# How To - Recipes

Here you will see different recipes or "how to" guides for **several topics**.

Most of these ideas would be more or less **independent**, and in most cases you should only need to study them if they apply directly to **your project**.

If something seems interesting and useful to your project, go ahead and check it, but otherwise, you might probably just skip them.

!!! tip

    If you want to **learn FastAPI** in a structured way (recommended), go and read the [Tutorial - User Guide](../tutorial/index.md){.internal-link target=_blank} chapter by chapter instead.
