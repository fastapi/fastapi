# Dependencies - `Depends()` and `Security()`

## `Depends()`

Dependencies are handled mainly with the special function `Depends()` that takes a
callable.

Here is the reference for it and its parameters.

You can import it directly from `fastapi`:

```python
from fastapi import Depends
```

::: fastapi.Depends

## `Security()`

For many scenarios, you can handle security (authorization, authentication, etc.) with
dependendencies, using `Depends()`.

But when you want to also declare OAuth2 scopes, you can use `Security()` instead of
`Depends()`.

You can import `Security()` directly from `fastapi`:

```python
from fastapi import Security
```

::: fastapi.Security
