## Ã–nce Ã–ÄŸreticiyi Okuyun

You could still use most of the features in **FastAPI** with the knowledge from the main [Tutorial - User Guide](../tutorial/index.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

And the next sections assume you already read it, and assume that you know those main ideas.

## DiÄŸer Kurslar

Although the [Tutorial - User Guide](../tutorial/index.md){.internal-link target=_blank} and this **Advanced User Guide** are written as a guided tutorial (like a book) and should be enough for you to **learn FastAPI**, you might want to complement it with additional courses.

Or it might be the case that you just prefer to take other courses because they adapt better to your learning style.

Some course providers âœ¨ [**sponsor FastAPI**](../help-fastapi.md#sponsor-the-author){.internal-link target=_blank} âœ¨, this ensures the continued and healthy **development** of FastAPI and its **ecosystem**.

And it shows their true commitment to FastAPI and its **community** (you), as they not only want to provide you a **good learning experience** but also want to make sure you have a **good and healthy framework**, FastAPI. ğŸ™‡
