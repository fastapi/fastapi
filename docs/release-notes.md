## Latest changes

## 0.42.0

* Add dependencies with `yield`, a.k.a. exit steps, context managers, cleanup, teardown, ...
    * This allows adding extra code after a dependency is done. It can be used, for example, to close database connections.
    * Dependencies with `yield` can be normal or `async`, **FastAPI** will run normal dependencies in a threadpool.
    * They can be combined with normal dependencies.
    * It's possible to have arbitrary trees/levels of dependencies with `yield` and exit steps are handled in the correct order automatically.
    * It works by default in Python 3.7 or above. For Python 3.6, it requires the extra backport dependencies:
        * `async-exit-stack`
        * `async-generator`
    * New docs at [Dependencies with `yield`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/dependencies-with-yield/).
    * Updated database docs [SQL (Relational) Databases: Main **FastAPI** app](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/sql-databases/#main-fastapi-app).
    * PR [#595](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/595).
* Fix `sitemap.xml` in website. PR [#598](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/598) by [@samuelcolvin](https://github.com/samuelcolvin).

## 0.41.0

* Upgrade required Starlette to `0.12.9`, the new range is `>=0.12.9,<=0.12.9`.
    * Add `State` to FastAPI apps at `app.state`.
    * PR [#593](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/593).
* Improve handling of custom classes for `Request`s and `APIRoute`s.
    * This helps to more easily solve use cases like:
        * Reading a body before and/or after a request (equivalent to a middleware).
        * Run middleware-like code only for a subset of *path operations*.
        * Process a request before passing it to a *path operation function*. E.g. decompressing, deserializing, etc.
        * Processing a response after being generated by *path operation functions* but before returning it. E.g. adding custom headers, logging, adding extra metadata.
    * New docs section: [Custom Request and APIRoute class](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/custom-request-and-route/).
    * PR [#589](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/589) by [@dmontagu](https://github.com/dmontagu).

## 0.39.0

* Allow path parameters to have default values (e.g. `None`) and discard them instead of raising an error.
    * This allows declaring a parameter like `user_id: str = None` that can be taken from a query parameter, but the same path operation can be included in a router with a path `/users/{user_id}`, in which case will be taken from the path and will be required.
    * PR [#464](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/464) by [@jonathanunderwood](https://github.com/jonathanunderwood).
* Add support for setting a `default_response_class` in the `FastAPI` instance or in `include_router`. Initial PR [#467](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/467) by [@toppk](https://github.com/toppk).

    * This allows having a router for `/cats` and all its *path operations*, while having one of them for `/cats`.
    * Now it doesn't have to be only `/cats/` (with a trailing slash).
    * To use it, declare the path in the *path operation* as the empty string (`""`).
    * PR [#415](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/415) by [@vitalik](https://github.com/vitalik).
* Fix mypy error after merging PR #415. PR [#462](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/462).

## 0.33.0

* Upgrade Pydantic version to `0.30.0`. PR [#384](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/384) by [@jekirl](https://github.com/jekirl).

## 0.32.0

* Fix typo in docs for features. PR [#380](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/380) by [@MartinoMensio](https://github.com/MartinoMensio).

* Fix source code `limit` for example in [Query Parameters](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/query-params/). PR [#366](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/366) by [@Smashman](https://github.com/Smashman).

* Add note to docs: [Include the same router multiple times with different `prefix`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/bigger-applications/#include-the-same-router-multiple-times-with-different-prefix). PR [#348](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/348).

* Fix OpenAPI/JSON Schema generation for two functions with the same name (in different modules) with the same composite bodies.
    * Composite bodies' IDs are now based on path, not only on route name, as the auto-generated name uses the function names, that can be duplicated in different modules.
    * The same new ID generation applies to response models.
    * This also changes the generated title for those models.
    * Only composite bodies and response models are affected because those are generated dynamically, they don't have a module (a Python file).
    * This also adds the possibility of using `.include_router()` with the same `APIRouter` *multiple*  times, with different prefixes, e.g. `/api/v2` and `/api/latest`, and it will now work correctly.
    * PR [#347](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/347).

## 0.31.0

* Upgrade Pydantic supported version to `0.29.0`.
    * New supported version range is `"pydantic >=0.28,<=0.29.0"`.
    * This adds support for Pydantic [Generic Models](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/#generic-models), kudos to [@dmontagu](https://github.com/dmontagu).
    * PR [#344](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/344).

## 0.30.0

* Add support for Pydantic's ORM mode:
    * Updated documentation about SQL with SQLAlchemy, using Pydantic models with ORM mode, SQLAlchemy models with relations, separation of files, simplification of code and other changes. New docs: [SQL (Relational) Databases](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/sql-databases/).
    * The new support for ORM mode fixes issues/adds features related to ORMs with lazy-loading, hybrid properties, dynamic/getters (using `@property` decorators) and several other use cases.
    * This applies to ORMs like SQLAlchemy, Peewee, Tortoise ORM, GINO ORM and virtually any other.
    * If your *path operations* return an arbitrary object with attributes (e.g. `my_item.name` instead of `my_item["name"]`) AND you use a `response_model`, make sure to update the Pydantic models with `orm_mode = True` as described in the docs (link above).
    * New documentation about receiving plain `dict`s as request bodies: [Bodies of arbitrary `dict`s](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/body-nested-models/#bodies-of-arbitrary-dicts).
    * New documentation about returning arbitrary `dict`s in responses: [Response with arbitrary `dict`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/extra-models/#response-with-arbitrary-dict).
    * **Technical Details**:
        * When declaring a `response_model` it is used directly to generate the response content, from whatever was returned from the *path operation function*.
        * Before this, the return content was first passed through `jsonable_encoder` to ensure it was a "jsonable" object, like a `dict`, instead of an arbitrary object with attributes (like an ORM model). That's why you should make sure to update your Pydantic models for objects with attributes to use `orm_mode = True`.
        * If you don't have a `response_model`, the return object will still be passed through `jsonable_encoder` first.
        * When a `response_model` is declared, the same `response_model` type declaration won't be used as is, it will be "cloned" to create an new one (a cloned Pydantic `Field` with all the submodels cloned as well).
        * This avoids/fixes a potential security issue: as the returned object is passed directly to Pydantic, if the returned object was a subclass of the `response_model` (e.g. you return a `UserInDB` that inherits from `User` but contains extra fields, like `hashed_password`, and `User` is used in the `response_model`), it would still pass the validation (because `UserInDB` is a subclass of `User`) and the object would be returned as-is, including the `hashed_password`. To fix this, the declared `response_model` is cloned, if it is a Pydantic model class (or contains Pydantic model classes in it, e.g. in a `List[Item]`), the Pydantic model class(es) will be a different one (the "cloned" one). So, an object that is a subclass won't simply pass the validation and returned as-is, because it is no longer a sub-class of the cloned `response_model`. Instead, a new Pydantic model object will be created with the contents of the returned object. So, it will be a new object (made with the data from the returned one), and will be filtered by the cloned `response_model`, containing only the declared fields as normally.
    * PR [#322](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/322).

* Remove/clean unused RegEx code in routing. PR [#314](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/314) by [@dmontagu](https://github.com/dmontagu).

* Use default response status code descriptions for additional responses. PR [#313](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/313) by [@duxiaoyao](https://github.com/duxiaoyao).

* Upgrade Pydantic support to `0.28`. PR [#320](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/320) by [@jekirl](https://github.com/jekirl).

## 0.29.1

* Fix handling an empty-body request with a required body param. PR [#311](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/311).

* Fix broken link in docs: [Return a Response directly](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-directly/). PR [#306](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/306) by [@dmontagu](https://github.com/dmontagu).

* Fix docs discrepancy in docs for [Response Model](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/). PR [#288](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/288) by [@awiddersheim](https://github.com/awiddersheim).

## 0.29.0

* Add support for declaring a `Response` parameter:
    * This allows declaring:
        * [Response Cookies](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-cookies/).
        * [Response Headers](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-headers/).
        * An HTTP Status Code different than the default: [Response - Change Status Code](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-change-status-code/).
    * All of this while still being able to return arbitrary objects (`dict`, DB model, etc).
    * Update attribution to Hug, for inspiring the `response` parameter pattern.
    * PR [#294](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/294).

## 0.28.0

* Implement dependency cache per request.
    * This avoids calling each dependency multiple times for the same request.
    * This is useful while calling external services, performing costly computation, etc.
    * This also means that if a dependency was declared as a *path operation decorator* dependency, possibly at the router level (with `.include_router()`) and then it is declared again in a specific *path operation*, the dependency will be called only once.
    * The cache can be disabled per dependency declaration, using `use_cache=False` as in `Depends(your_dependency, use_cache=False)`.
    * Updated docs at: [Using the same dependency multiple times](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/sub-dependencies/#using-the-same-dependency-multiple-times).
    * PR [#292](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/292).

* Implement dependency overrides for testing.
    * This allows using overrides/mocks of dependencies during tests.
    * New docs: [Testing Dependencies with Overrides](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/testing-dependencies/).
    * PR [#291](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/291).

## 0.27.2

* Fix path and query parameters receiving `dict` as a valid type. It should be mapped to a body payload. PR [#287](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/287). Updated docs at: [Query parameter list / multiple values with defaults: Using `list`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/query-params-str-validations/#using-list).

## 0.27.1

* Fix `auto_error=False` handling in `HTTPBearer` security scheme. Do not `raise` when there's an incorrect `Authorization` header if `auto_error=False`. PR [#282](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/282).

* Fix type declaration of `HTTPException`. PR [#279](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/279).

## 0.27.0

    * Large refactor, improvement, and simplification of param extraction from *path operations*.
    * Fix/add support for list *query parameters* with list defaults. New documentation: [Query parameter list / multiple values with defaults](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/query-params-str-validations/#query-parameter-list-multiple-values-with-defaults).
    * Add support for enumerations in *path operation* parameters. New documentation: [Path Parameters: Predefined values](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-params/#predefined-values).
    * Add support for type annotations using `Optional` as in `param: Optional[str] = None`. New documentation: [Optional type declarations](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/query-params/#optional-type-declarations).
    * PR [#278](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/278).

## 0.26.0

    * This will allow developers to customize the exception handlers.
    * Document better how to handle exceptions and use error handlers.
    * Include `RequestValidationError` and `WebSocketRequestValidationError` (this last one will be useful once [encode/starlette#527](https://github.com/encode/starlette/pull/527) or equivalent is merged).
    * New documentation about exceptions handlers:
        * [Install custom exception handlers](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/handling-errors/#install-custom-exception-handlers).
        * [Override the default exception handlers](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/handling-errors/#override-the-default-exception-handlers).
        * [Re-use **FastAPI's** exception handlers](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/handling-errors/#re-use-fastapis-exception-handlers).

    * Update documentation: [Response Model](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_include-and-response_model_exclude).
    * Add docs for: [Body - updates](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/body-updates/), using Pydantic's `skip_defaults`.
    * Add method consistency tests.
    * PR [#264](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/264).

* Upgrade the compatible version of Starlette to `0.12.0`.
    * This includes support for ASGI 3 (the latest version of the standard).
    * It's now possible to use [Starlette's `StreamingResponse`](https://www.starlette.io/responses/#streamingresponse) with iterators, like [file-like](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-file-like-object) objects (as those returned by `open()`).
    * It's now possible to use the low level utility `iterate_in_threadpool` from `starlette.concurrency` (for advanced scenarios).
    * PR [#243](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/243).

* Add OAuth2 redirect page for Swagger UI. This allows having delegated authentication in the Swagger UI docs. For this to work, you need to add `{your_origin}/docs/oauth2-redirect` to the allowed callbacks in your OAuth2 provider (in Auth0, Facebook, Google, etc).
    * For example, during development, it could be `http://localhost:8000/docs/oauth2-redirect`.
    * Have in mind that this callback URL is independent of whichever one is used by your frontend. You might also have another callback at `https://yourdomain.com/login/callback`.
    * This is only to allow delegated authentication in the API docs with Swagger UI.
    * PR [#198](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/198) by [@steinitzu](https://github.com/steinitzu).

* Make Swagger UI and ReDoc route handlers (*path operations*) be `async` functions instead of lambdas to improve performance. PR [#241](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/241) by [@Trim21](https://github.com/Trim21).

* Make Swagger UI and ReDoc URLs parameterizable, allowing to host and serve local versions of them and have offline docs. PR [#112](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/112) by [@euri10](https://github.com/euri10).

## 0.22.0

* Add support for `dependencies` parameter:
    * A parameter in *path operation decorators*, for dependencies that should be executed but the return value is not important or not used in the *path operation function*.
    * A parameter in the `.include_router()` method of FastAPI applications and routers, to include dependencies that should be executed in each *path operation* in a router.
        * This is useful, for example, to require authentication or permissions in specific group of *path operations*.
        * Different `dependencies` can be applied to different routers.
    * These `dependencies` are run before the normal parameter dependencies. And normal dependencies are run too. They can be combined.
    * Dependencies declared in a router are executed first, then the ones defined in *path operation decorators*, and then the ones declared in normal parameters. They are all combined and executed.
    * All this also supports using `Security` with `scopes` in those `dependencies` parameters, for more advanced OAuth 2.0 security scenarios with scopes.
    * New documentation about [dependencies in *path operation decorators*](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/dependencies-in-path-operation-decorators/).
    * New documentation about [dependencies in the `include_router()` method](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/bigger-applications/#include-an-apirouter-with-a-prefix-tags-responses-and-dependencies).
