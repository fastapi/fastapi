"""A helper module that injects SecureTransport, on import.

The import should be done as early as possible, to ensure all requests and
sessions (or whatever) are created after injecting SecureTransport.

Note that we only do the injection on macOS, when the linked OpenSSL is too
old to handle TLSv1.2.
