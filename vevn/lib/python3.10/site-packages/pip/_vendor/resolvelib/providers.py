        necessarily in this order):

        * Is this package pinned in the current resolution result?
        * How relaxed is the requirement? Stricter ones should probably be

          with few left should likely be worked on first, I guess?

          probably work on those with the most known conflicts.

        parameter of the built-in sorting function). The smaller the value is,
