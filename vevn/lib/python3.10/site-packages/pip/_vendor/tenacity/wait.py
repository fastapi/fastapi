    An exponential backoff strategy used to mediate contention between multiple
    uncoordinated processes for a shared resource in distributed systems. This
    is the sense in which "exponential backoff" is meant in e.g. Ethernet
    networking, and corresponds to the "Full Jitter" algorithm described in
    this blog post:

    https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/exponential-backoff-and-jitter/

    Each retry occurs at a random time in a geometrically expanding interval.
    It allows for a custom multiplier and an ability to restrict the upper
    limit of the random interval to some maximum value.

    Example::

        wait_random_exponential(multiplier=0.5,  # initial window 0.5s
                                max=60)          # max 60s timeout

    When waiting for an unavailable resource to become available again, as
    opposed to trying to resolve contention for a shared resource, the
    wait_exponential strategy (which uses a fixed interval) may be preferable.
