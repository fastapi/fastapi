"""Dependency Resolution

The dependency resolution in pip is performed as follows:

for top-level requirements:
    a. only one spec allowed per project, regardless of conflicts or not.
       otherwise a "double requirement" exception is raised
    b. they override sub-dependency requirements.
for sub-dependencies
    a. "first found, wins" (where the order is breadth first)
