# Notes on the relationship between the provider, the factory, and the
# candidate and requirement classes.
#
# The provider is a direct implementation of the resolvelib class. Its role
# is to deliver the API that resolvelib expects.
#
# Rather than work with completely abstract "requirement" and "candidate"
# concepts as resolvelib does, pip has concrete classes implementing these two
# ideas. The API of Requirement and Candidate objects are defined in the base
# classes, but essentially map fairly directly to the equivalent provider
# methods. In particular, `find_matches` and `is_satisfied_by` are
# requirement methods, and `get_dependencies` is a candidate method.
#
# The factory is the interface to pip's internal mechanisms. It is stateless,
# and is created by the resolver and held as a property of the provider. It is
# responsible for creating Requirement and Candidate objects, and provides
# services to those objects (access to pip's finder and preparer).
