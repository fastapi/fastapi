"""Utilities to lazily create and visit candidates found.

Creating and visiting a candidate is a *very* costly operation. It involves
fetching, extracting, potentially building modules from source, and verifying
distribution metadata. It is therefore crucial for performance to keep
everything here lazy all the way down, so we only touch candidates that we
absolutely need, and not "download the world" when we only need one version of
something.
