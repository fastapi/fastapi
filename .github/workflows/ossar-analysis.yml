    # Ensure a compatible version of dotnet is installed.
    # The [Microsoft Security Code Analysis CLI](https://aka.ms/mscadocs) is built with dotnet v3.1.201.
    # A version greater than or equal to v3.1.201 of dotnet must be installed on the agent in order to run this action.
    # GitHub hosted runners already have a compatible version of dotnet installed and this step may be skipped.
    # For self-hosted runners, ensure dotnet version 3.1.201 or later is installed by including this action:
    # - name: Install .NET
    #   uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v1
    #   with:
    #     dotnet-version: '3.1.x'
