                etc.

                It will be used for:

                * Documentation: the generated OpenAPI (and the UI at `/docs`) will
                    show it as the response (JSON Schema).
                * Serialization: you could return an arbitrary object and the
                    `response_model` would be used to serialize that object into the
                    corresponding JSON.
                * Filtering: the JSON sent to the client will only contain the data
                    (fields) defined in the `response_model`. If you returned an object
                    that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does
                    not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have
                    that `password`.
                * Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the
                    `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the
                    corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not
                    valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,
                    so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an
                    error and return a 500 error code (Internal Server Error).

                etc.

                It will be used for:

                * Documentation: the generated OpenAPI (and the UI at `/docs`) will
                    show it as the response (JSON Schema).
                * Serialization: you could return an arbitrary object and the
                    `response_model` would be used to serialize that object into the
                    corresponding JSON.
                * Filtering: the JSON sent to the client will only contain the data
                    (fields) defined in the `response_model`. If you returned an object
                    that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does
                    not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have
                    that `password`.
                * Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the
                    `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the
                    corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not
                    valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,
                    so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an
                    error and return a 500 error code (Internal Server Error).

                etc.

                It will be used for:

                * Documentation: the generated OpenAPI (and the UI at `/docs`) will
                    show it as the response (JSON Schema).
                * Serialization: you could return an arbitrary object and the
                    `response_model` would be used to serialize that object into the
                    corresponding JSON.
                * Filtering: the JSON sent to the client will only contain the data
                    (fields) defined in the `response_model`. If you returned an object
                    that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does
                    not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have
                    that `password`.
                * Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the
                    `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the
                    corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not
                    valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,
                    so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an
                    error and return a 500 error code (Internal Server Error).

                be a Pydantic model, it could be other things, like a `list`, `dict`,
                etc.

                It will be used for:

                * Documentation: the generated OpenAPI (and the UI at `/docs`) will
                    show it as the response (JSON Schema).
                * Serialization: you could return an arbitrary object and the
                    `response_model` would be used to serialize that object into the
                    corresponding JSON.
                * Filtering: the JSON sent to the client will only contain the data
                    (fields) defined in the `response_model`. If you returned an object
                    that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does
                    not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have
                    that `password`.
                * Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the
                    `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the
                    corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not
                    valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,
                    so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an
                    error and return a 500 error code (Internal Server Error).

                be a Pydantic model, it could be other things, like a `list`, `dict`,
                etc.

                It will be used for:

                * Documentation: the generated OpenAPI (and the UI at `/docs`) will
                    show it as the response (JSON Schema).
                * Serialization: you could return an arbitrary object and the
                    `response_model` would be used to serialize that object into the
                    corresponding JSON.
                * Filtering: the JSON sent to the client will only contain the data
                    (fields) defined in the `response_model`. If you returned an object
                    that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does
                    not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have
                    that `password`.
                * Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the
                    `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the
                    corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not
                    valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,
                    so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an
                    error and return a 500 error code (Internal Server Error).

                * Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the
                    `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the
                    corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not
                    valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,
                    so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an
                    error and return a 500 error code (Internal Server Error).

                * Documentation: the generated OpenAPI (and the UI at `/docs`) will
                    show it as the response (JSON Schema).
                * Serialization: you could return an arbitrary object and the
                    `response_model` would be used to serialize that object into the
                    corresponding JSON.
                * Filtering: the JSON sent to the client will only contain the data
                    (fields) defined in the `response_model`. If you returned an object
                    that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does
                    not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have
                    that `password`.
                * Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the
                    `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the
                    corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not
                    valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,
                    so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an
                    error and return a 500 error code (Internal Server Error).
