    move because it does away with modifying the grammar to include all the

    This is why this function generates simple parentless Leaf objects for
    comments.  We simply don't know what the correct parent should be.

    No matter though, we can live without this.  We really only need to
    differentiate between inline and standalone comments.  The latter don't
