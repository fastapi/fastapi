packaging
=========

.. start-intro

Reusable core utilities for various Python Packaging
`interoperability specifications <https://packaging.python.org/specifications/>`_.

This library provides utilities that implement the interoperability
specifications which have clearly one correct behaviour (eg: :pep:`440`)
or benefit greatly from having a single shared implementation (eg: :pep:`425`).

.. end-intro

The ``packaging`` project includes the following: version handling, specifiers,
markers, requirements, tags, utilities.

Documentation
-------------

The `documentation`_ provides information and the API for the following:

- Version Handling
- Specifiers
- Markers
- Requirements
- Tags
- Utilities

Installation
------------

Use ``pip`` to install these utilities::

    pip install packaging

Discussion
----------

If you run into bugs, you can file them in our `issue tracker`_.

You can also join ``#pypa`` on Freenode to ask questions or get involved.
