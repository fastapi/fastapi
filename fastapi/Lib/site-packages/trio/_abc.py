    This class distinguishes between "graceful" closes, which may perform I/O

    shutting down a TLS-encrypted connection requires sending a "goodbye"
    message; but if a peer has become non-responsive, then sending this

    instead. Therefore the :meth:`aclose` method is unusual in that it
    should always close the connection (or at least make its best attempt)
    *even if it fails*; failure indicates a failure to achieve grace, not a
    failure to close the connection.

    Objects that implement this interface can be used as async context
    managers, i.e., you can write::

      async with create_resource() as some_async_resource:
          ...

        underlying resources before returning. An error from this method
        indicates a failure to achieve grace, *not* a failure to close the
        connection.

        For example, suppose we call :meth:`aclose` on a TLS-encrypted
        connection. This requires sending a "goodbye" message; but if the peer

        Note:

          This method is intended to aid in implementing protocols that want
          to delay choosing which data to send until the last moment. E.g.,
          suppose you're working on an implementation of a remote display server
          like `VNC
          <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Network_Computing>`__, and
          the network connection is currently backed up so that if you call
          :meth:`send_all` now then it will sit for 0.5 seconds before actually
          sending anything. In this case it doesn't make sense to take a
          screenshot, then wait 0.5 seconds, and then send it, because the
          screen will keep changing while you wait; it's better to wait 0.5
          seconds, then take the screenshot, and then send it, because this
          way the data you deliver will be more
          up-to-date. Using :meth:`wait_send_all_might_not_block` makes it
          possible to implement the better strategy.

          If you use this method, you might also want to read up on
