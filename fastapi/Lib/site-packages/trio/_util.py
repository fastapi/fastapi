# Equivalent to the C function raise(), which Python doesn't wrap
if os.name == "nt":
    # On windows, os.kill exists but is really weird.
    #
    # If you give it CTRL_C_EVENT or CTRL_BREAK_EVENT, it tries to deliver
    # those using GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent. But I found that when I tried
    # to run my test normally, it would freeze waiting... unless I added
    # print statements, in which case the test suddenly worked. So I guess
    # these signals are only delivered if/when you access the console? I
    # don't really know what was going on there. From reading the
    # GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent docs I don't know how it worked at all.
    #
    # I later spent a bunch of time trying to make GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent
    # work for creating synthetic control-C events, and... failed
    # utterly. There are lots of details in the code and comments
    # removed/added at this commit:
    #     https://github.com/python-trio/trio/commit/95843654173e3e826c34d70a90b369ba6edf2c23
    #
    # OTOH, if you pass os.kill any *other* signal number... then CPython
    # just calls TerminateProcess (wtf).
    #
    # So, anyway, os.kill is not so useful for testing purposes. Instead
    # we use raise():
    #
    #   https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dwwzkt4c.aspx

    # Have to import cffi inside the 'if os.name' block because we don't
    # depend on cffi on non-Windows platforms. (It would be easy to switch
    # this to ctypes though if we ever remove the cffi dependency.)
    #
    # Some more information:
    #   https://bugs.python.org/issue26350
    #
    # Anyway, we use this for two things:
    # - redelivering unhandled signals
    # - generating synthetic signals for tests
    # and for both of those purposes, 'raise' works fine.
