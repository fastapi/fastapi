    #
    # 1. start_thread_soon grabs the worker thread, assigns it a job, and
    #    releases its lock.
    # 2. The worker thread wakes up (because the lock has been released), but
    #    the JankyLock lies to it and tells it that the lock timed out. So the

    #    assigned a job, and discovers that it *is* in the process of being
    #    assigned a job, so it loops around and tries to acquire the lock
    #    again.
