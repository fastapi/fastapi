# The "thread cache" is a simple unbounded thread pool, i.e., it automatically
# spawns as many threads as needed to handle all the requests its given. Its
# only purpose is to cache worker threads so that they don't have to be
# started from scratch every time we want to delegate some work to a thread.
# It's expected that some higher-level code will track how many threads are in
# use to avoid overwhelming the system (e.g. the limiter= argument to
# trio.to_thread.run_sync).
#
# To maximize sharing, there's only one thread cache per process, even if you
# have multiple calls to trio.run.
#
# Guarantees:
#
# It's safe to call start_thread_soon simultaneously from
# multiple threads.
#
# Idle threads are chosen in LIFO order, i.e. we *don't* spread work evenly
# over all threads. Instead we try to let some threads do most of the work
# while others sit idle as much as possible. Compared to FIFO, this has better
# memory cache behavior, and it makes it easier to detect when we have too
# many threads, so idle ones can exit.
#
# This code assumes that 'dict' has the following properties:
#
# - __setitem__, __delitem__, and popitem are all thread-safe and atomic with
#   respect to each other. This is guaranteed by the GIL.
#
# - popitem returns the most-recently-added item (i.e., __setitem__ + popitem
#   give you a LIFO queue). This relies on dicts being insertion-ordered, like
#   they are in py36+.

# How long a thread will idle waiting for new work before gives up and exits.
# This value is pretty arbitrary; I don't think it matters too much.

def start_thread_soon(fn, deliver):
    """Runs ``deliver(outcome.capture(fn))`` in a worker thread.

    Generally ``fn`` does some blocking work, and ``deliver`` delivers the
    result back to whoever is interested.

    This is a low-level, no-frills interface, very similar to using
    `threading.Thread` to spawn a thread directly. The main difference is
    that this function tries to re-use threads when possible, so it can be
    a bit faster than `threading.Thread`.

    Worker threads have the `~threading.Thread.daemon` flag set, which means
    that if your main thread exits, worker threads will automatically be
    killed. If you want to make sure that your ``fn`` runs to completion, then
    you should make sure that the main thread remains alive until ``deliver``
    is called.

    It is safe to call this function simultaneously from multiple threads.

    Args:

        fn (sync function): Performs arbitrary blocking work.

        deliver (sync function): Takes the `outcome.Outcome` of ``fn``, and
          delivers it. *Must not block.*

    Because worker threads are cached and reused for multiple calls, neither
    function should mutate thread-level state, like `threading.local` objects
    â€“ or if they do, they should be careful to revert their changes before
    returning.

    Note:

        The split between ``fn`` and ``deliver`` serves two purposes. First,
        it's convenient, since most callers need something like this anyway.

        Second, it avoids a small race condition that could cause too many
        threads to be spawned. Consider a program that wants to run several
        jobs sequentially on a thread, so the main thread submits a job, waits
        for it to finish, submits another job, etc. In theory, this program
        should only need one worker thread. But what could happen is:

        1. Worker thread: First job finishes, and calls ``deliver``.

        2. Main thread: receives notification that the job finished, and calls
           ``start_thread_soon``.

        3. Main thread: sees that no worker threads are marked idle, so spawns
           a second worker thread.

        4. Original worker thread: marks itself as idle.

        To avoid this, threads mark themselves as idle *before* calling
        ``deliver``.

        Is this potential extra thread a major problem? Maybe not, but it's
        easy enough to avoid, and we figure that if the user is trying to
        limit how many threads they're using then it's polite to respect that.
