################################################################


def _filter_impl(handler, root_exc):
    # We have a tree of MultiError's, like:
    #
    #  MultiError([
    #      ValueError,
    #      MultiError([
    #          KeyError,
    #          ValueError,
    #      ]),
    #  ])
    #
    # or similar.
    #
    # We want to
    # 1) apply the filter to each of the leaf exceptions -- each leaf
    #    might stay the same, be replaced (with the original exception
    #    potentially sticking around as __context__ or __cause__), or
    #    disappear altogether.
    # 2) simplify the resulting tree -- remove empty nodes, and replace
    #    singleton MultiError's with their contents, e.g.:
    #        MultiError([KeyError]) -> KeyError
    #    (This can happen recursively, e.g. if the two ValueErrors above
    #    get caught then we'll just be left with a bare KeyError.)
    # 3) preserve sensible tracebacks
    #
    # It's the tracebacks that are most confusing. As a MultiError
    # propagates through the stack, it accumulates traceback frames, but
    # the exceptions inside it don't. Semantically, the traceback for a
    # leaf exception is the concatenation the tracebacks of all the
    # exceptions you see when traversing the exception tree from the root
    # to that leaf. Our correctness invariant is that this concatenated
    # traceback should be the same before and after.
    #
    # The easy way to do that would be to, at the beginning of this
    # function, "push" all tracebacks down to the leafs, so all the
    # MultiErrors have __traceback__=None, and all the leafs have complete
    # tracebacks. But whenever possible, we'd actually prefer to keep
    # tracebacks as high up in the tree as possible, because this lets us
    # keep only a single copy of the common parts of these exception's
    # tracebacks. This is cheaper (in memory + time -- tracebacks are
    # unpleasantly quadratic-ish to work with, and this might matter if
    # you have thousands of exceptions, which can happen e.g. after
    # cancelling a large task pool, and no-one will ever look at their
    # tracebacks!), and more importantly, factoring out redundant parts of
    # the tracebacks makes them more readable if/when users do see them.
    #
    # So instead our strategy is:
    # - first go through and construct the new tree, preserving any
    #   unchanged subtrees
    # - then go through the original tree (!) and push tracebacks down
    #   until either we hit a leaf, or we hit a subtree which was
    #   preserved in the new tree.

    # This used to also support async handler functions. But that runs into:
    #   https://bugs.python.org/issue29600
