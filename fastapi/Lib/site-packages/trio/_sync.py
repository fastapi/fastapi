    """A waitable boolean value useful for inter-task synchronization,
    inspired by :class:`threading.Event`.

    An event object has an internal boolean flag, representing whether
    the event has happened yet. The flag is initially False, and the
    :meth:`wait` method waits until the flag is True. If the flag is
    already True, then :meth:`wait` returns immediately. (If the event has
    already happened, there's nothing to wait for.) The :meth:`set` method
    sets the flag to True, and wakes up any waiters.

    This behavior is useful because it helps avoid race conditions and
    lost wakeups: it doesn't matter whether :meth:`set` gets called just
    before or after :meth:`wait`. If you want a lower-level wakeup
    primitive that doesn't have this protection, consider :class:`Condition`
    or :class:`trio.lowlevel.ParkingLot`.

       `~threading.Event.clear` method. In Trio, once an `Event` has happened,
       it cannot un-happen. If you need to represent a series of events,
       consider creating a new `Event` object for each one (they're cheap!),
       or other synchronization methods like :ref:`channels <channels>` or
       `trio.lowlevel.ParkingLot`.

class CapacityLimiter(metaclass=Final):
    """An object for controlling access to a resource with limited capacity.

    Sometimes you need to put a limit on how many tasks can do something at
    the same time. For example, you might want to use some threads to run
    multiple blocking I/O operations in parallel... but if you use too many
    threads at once, then your system can become overloaded and it'll actually
    make things slower. One popular solution is to impose a policy like "run
    up to 40 threads at the same time, but no more". But how do you implement
    a policy like this?

    That's what :class:`CapacityLimiter` is for. You can think of a
    :class:`CapacityLimiter` object as a sack that starts out holding some fixed
    number of tokens::

       limit = trio.CapacityLimiter(40)

    Then tasks can come along and borrow a token out of the sack::

       # Borrow a token:
       async with limit:
           # We are holding a token!
           await perform_expensive_operation()
       # Exiting the 'async with' block puts the token back into the sack

    And crucially, if you try to borrow a token but the sack is empty, then
    you have to wait for another task to finish what it's doing and put its
    token back first before you can take it and continue.

    Another way to think of it: a :class:`CapacityLimiter` is like a sofa with a
    fixed number of seats, and if they're all taken then you have to wait for
    someone to get up before you can sit down.

    By default, :func:`trio.to_thread.run_sync` uses a
    :class:`CapacityLimiter` to limit the number of threads running at once;
    see `trio.to_thread.current_default_thread_limiter` for details.

    If you're familiar with semaphores, then you can think of this as a
    restricted semaphore that's specialized for one common use case, with
    additional error checking. For a more traditional semaphore, see
    :class:`Semaphore`.

    .. note::

       Don't confuse this with the `"leaky bucket"
       <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_bucket>`__ or `"token bucket"
       <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket>`__ algorithms used to
       limit bandwidth usage on networks. The basic idea of using tokens to
       track a resource limit is similar, but this is a very simple sack where
       tokens aren't automatically created or destroyed over time; they're
       just borrowed and then put back.

class StrictFIFOLock(_LockImpl, metaclass=Final):
    r"""A variant of :class:`Lock` where tasks are guaranteed to acquire the
    lock in strict first-come-first-served order.

    An example of when this is useful is if you're implementing something like
    :class:`trio.SSLStream` or an HTTP/2 server using `h2
    <https://hyper-h2.readthedocs.io/>`__, where you have multiple concurrent
    tasks that are interacting with a shared state machine, and at
    unpredictable moments the state machine requests that a chunk of data be
    sent over the network. (For example, when using h2 simply reading incoming
    data can occasionally `create outgoing data to send
    <https://http2.github.io/http2-spec/#PING>`__.) The challenge is to make
    sure that these chunks are sent in the correct order, without being
    garbled.

    One option would be to use a regular :class:`Lock`, and wrap it around
    every interaction with the state machine::

        # This approach is sometimes workable but often sub-optimal; see below
        async with lock:
            state_machine.do_something()
            if state_machine.has_data_to_send():
                await conn.sendall(state_machine.get_data_to_send())

    But this can be problematic. If you're using h2 then *usually* reading
    incoming data doesn't create the need to send any data, so we don't want
    to force every task that tries to read from the network to sit and wait
    a potentially long time for ``sendall`` to finish. And in some situations
    this could even potentially cause a deadlock, if the remote peer is
    waiting for you to read some data before it accepts the data you're
    sending.

    :class:`StrictFIFOLock` provides an alternative. We can rewrite our
    example like::

        # Note: no awaits between when we start using the state machine and
        # when we block to take the lock!
        state_machine.do_something()
        if state_machine.has_data_to_send():
            # Notice that we fetch the data to send out of the state machine
            # *before* sleeping, so that other tasks won't see it.
            chunk = state_machine.get_data_to_send()
            async with strict_fifo_lock:
                await conn.sendall(chunk)

    First we do all our interaction with the state machine in a single
    scheduling quantum (notice there are no ``await``\s in there), so it's
    automatically atomic with respect to other tasks. And then if and only if
    we have data to send, we get in line to send it – and
    :class:`StrictFIFOLock` guarantees that each task will send its data in
    the same order that the state machine generated it.

    Currently, :class:`StrictFIFOLock` is identical to :class:`Lock`,
    but (a) this may not always be true in the future, especially if Trio ever
    implements `more sophisticated scheduling policies
    <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/32>`__, and (b) the above code
    is relying on a pretty subtle property of its lock. Using a
    :class:`StrictFIFOLock` acts as an executable reminder that you're relying
    on this property.
