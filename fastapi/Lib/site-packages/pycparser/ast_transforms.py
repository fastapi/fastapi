def fix_switch_cases(switch_node):
    """The 'case' statements in a 'switch' come out of parsing with one
    child node, so subsequent statements are just tucked to the parent
    Compound. Additionally, consecutive (fall-through) case statements
    come out messy. This is a peculiarity of the C grammar. The following:

        switch (myvar) {
            case 10:
                k = 10;
                p = k + 1;
                return 10;
            case 20:
            case 30:
                return 20;
            default:
                break;
        }

    Creates this tree (pseudo-dump):

        Switch
            ID: myvar
            Compound:
                Case 10:
                    k = 10
                p = k + 1
                return 10
                Case 20:
                    Case 30:
                        return 20
                Default:
                    break

    The goal of this transform is to fix this mess, turning it into the
    following:

        Switch
            ID: myvar
            Compound:
                Case 10:
                    k = 10
                    p = k + 1
                    return 10
                Case 20:
                Case 30:
                    return 20
                Default:
                    break
