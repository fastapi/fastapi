# HTTP Core

[![Test Suite](https://github.com/encode/httpcore/workflows/Test%20Suite/badge.svg)](https://github.com/encode/httpcore/actions)
[![Package version](https://badge.fury.io/py/httpcore.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/httpcore/)

> *Do one thing, and do it well.*

The HTTP Core package provides a minimal low-level HTTP client, which does
one thing only. Sending HTTP requests.

It does not provide any high level model abstractions over the API,
does not handle redirects, multipart uploads, building authentication headers,
transparent HTTP caching, URL parsing, session cookie handling,
content or charset decoding, handling JSON, environment based configuration
defaults, or any of that Jazz.

Some things HTTP Core does do:

* Sending HTTP requests.
* Thread-safe / task-safe connection pooling.
* HTTP(S) proxy & SOCKS proxy support.
* Supports HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.
* Provides both sync and async interfaces.
* Async backend support for `asyncio` and `trio`.

## Requirements

Python 3.7+

## Installation

For HTTP/1.1 only support, install with:

```shell
$ pip install httpcore
```

For HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 support, install with:

```shell
$ pip install httpcore[http2]
```

For SOCKS proxy support, install with:

```shell
$ pip install httpcore[socks]
```

# Sending requests

Send an HTTP request:

```python
import httpcore

response = httpcore.request("GET", "https://www.example.com/")

print(response)
# <Response [200]>
print(response.status)
# 200
print(response.headers)
# [(b'Accept-Ranges', b'bytes'), (b'Age', b'557328'), (b'Cache-Control', b'max-age=604800'), ...]
print(response.content)
# b'<!doctype html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Example Domain</title>\n\n<meta charset="utf-8"/>\n ...'
```

The top-level `httpcore.request()` function is provided for convenience. In practice whenever you're working with `httpcore` you'll want to use the connection pooling functionality that it provides.

```python
import httpcore

http = httpcore.ConnectionPool()
response = http.request("GET", "https://www.example.com/")
```

Once you're ready to get going, [head over to the documentation](https://www.encode.io/httpcore/).

## Motivation

You *probably* don't want to be using HTTP Core directly. It might make sense if
you're writing something like a proxy service in Python, and you just want
something at the lowest possible level, but more typically you'll want to use
a higher level client library, such as `httpx`.

The motivation for `httpcore` is:

* To provide a reusable low-level client library, that other packages can then build on top of.
* To provide a *really clear interface split* between the networking code and client logic,
  so that each is easier to understand and reason about in isolation.

- `h2` is now strictly optional. (Pull #428)

## 0.14.0 (November 11th, 2021)

The 0.14 release is a complete reworking of `httpcore`, comprehensively addressing some underlying issues in the connection pooling, as well as substantially redesigning the API to be more user friendly.

Some of the lower-level API design also makes the components more easily testable in isolation, and the package now has 100% test coverage.

See [discussion #419](https://github.com/encode/httpcore/discussions/419) for a little more background.

There's some other neat bits in there too, such as the "trace" extension, which gives a hook into inspecting the internal events that occur during the request/response cycle. This extension is needed for the HTTPX cli, in order to...

* Log the point at which the connection is established, and the IP/port on which it is made.
* Determine if the outgoing request should log as HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2, rather than having to assume it's HTTP/2 if the --http2 flag was passed. (Which may not actually be true.)
* Log SSL version info / certificate info.

Note that `curio` support is not currently available in 0.14.0. If you're using `httpcore` with `curio` please get in touch, so we can assess if we ought to prioritize it as a feature or not.

## 0.13.7 (September 13th, 2021)

## 0.13.0 (April 21st, 2021)

The 0.13 release updates the core API in order to match the HTTPX Transport API,
introduced in HTTPX 0.18 onwards.

An example of making requests with the new interface is:

```python
with httpcore.SyncConnectionPool() as http:
    status_code, headers, stream, extensions = http.handle_request(
        method=b'GET',
        url=(b'https', b'example.org', 443, b'/'),
        headers=[(b'host', b'example.org'), (b'user-agent', b'httpcore')]
        stream=httpcore.ByteStream(b''),
        extensions={}
    )
    body = stream.read()
    print(status_code, body)
```

### Changed

- The `.request()` method is now `handle_request()`. (Pull #296)
- The `.arequest()` method is now `.handle_async_request()`. (Pull #296)
- The `headers` argument is no longer optional. (Pull #296)
- The `stream` argument is no longer optional. (Pull #296)
- The `ext` argument is now named `extensions`, and is no longer optional. (Pull #296)
- The `"reason"` extension keyword is now named `"reason_phrase"`. (Pull #296)
- The `"reason_phrase"` and `"http_version"` extensions now use byte strings for their values. (Pull #296)
- The `httpcore.PlainByteStream()` class becomes `httpcore.ByteStream()`. (Pull #296)

### Added

- Streams now support a `.read()` interface. (Pull #296)

### Fixed

- Task cancellation no longer leaks connections from the connection pool. (Pull #305)

## 0.12.3 (December 7th, 2020)

- Avoid leaking connections when establishing an HTTP tunnel to a proxy has failed. (Pull #223)
- Properly wrap OS errors when using `trio`. (Pull #225)

## 0.12.0 (October 6th, 2020)

### Changed

- HTTP header casing is now preserved, rather than always sent in lowercase. (#216 and python-hyper/h11#104)

### Added

- Add Python 3.9 to officially supported versions.

### Fixed

- Gracefully handle a stdlib asyncio bug when a connection is closed while it is in a paused-for-reading state. (#201)

## 0.11.1 (September 28nd, 2020)

### Fixed

- Add await to async semaphore release() coroutine (#197)
- Drop incorrect curio classifier (#192)

## 0.11.0 (September 22nd, 2020)

The Transport API with 0.11.0 has a couple of significant changes.

Firstly we've moved changed the request interface in order to allow extensions, which will later enable us to support features
such as trailing headers, HTTP/2 server push, and CONNECT/Upgrade connections.

The interface changes from:

```python
def request(method, url, headers, stream, timeout):
    return (http_version, status_code, reason, headers, stream)
```

To instead including an optional dictionary of extensions on the request and response:

```python
def request(method, url, headers, stream, ext):
    return (status_code, headers, stream, ext)
```

Having an open-ended extensions point will allow us to add later support for various optional features, that wouldn't otherwise be supported without these API changes.

In particular:

* Trailing headers support.
* HTTP/2 Server Push
* sendfile.
* Exposing raw connection on CONNECT, Upgrade, HTTP/2 bi-di streaming.
* Exposing debug information out of the API, including template name, template context.

Currently extensions are limited to:

* request: `timeout` - Optional. Timeout dictionary.
* response: `http_version` - Optional. Include the HTTP version used on the response.
* response: `reason` - Optional. Include the reason phrase used on the response. Only valid with HTTP/1.*.

See https://github.com/encode/httpx/issues/1274#issuecomment-694884553 for the history behind this.

Secondly, the async version of `request` is now namespaced as `arequest`.

This allows concrete transports to support both sync and async implementations on the same class.

### Added

- Add curio support. (Pull #168)
- Add anyio support, with `backend="anyio"`. (Pull #169)

### Changed

- Update the Transport API to use 'ext' for optional extensions. (Pull #190)
- Update the Transport API to use `.request` and `.arequest` so implementations can support both sync and async. (Pull #189)

## 0.10.2 (August 20th, 2020)

### Added

- Added Unix Domain Socket support. (Pull #139)

### Fixed

- Always include the port on proxy CONNECT requests. (Pull #154)
- Fix `max_keepalive_connections` configuration. (Pull #153)
- Fixes behaviour in HTTP/1.1 where server disconnects can be used to signal the end of the response body. (Pull #164)

## 0.10.1 (August 7th, 2020)

- Include `max_keepalive_connections` on `AsyncHTTPProxy`/`SyncHTTPProxy` classes.

## 0.10.0 (August 7th, 2020)

The most notable change in the 0.10.0 release is that HTTP/2 support is now fully optional.

Use either `pip install httpcore` for HTTP/1.1 support only, or `pip install httpcore[http2]` for HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 support.
