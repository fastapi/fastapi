> “Any color you like.”

_Black_ is the uncompromising Python code formatter. By using it, you agree to cede
control over minutiae of hand-formatting. In return, _Black_ gives you speed,
determinism, and freedom from `pycodestyle` nagging about formatting. You will save time
and mental energy for more important matters.

Blackened code looks the same regardless of the project you're reading. Formatting
becomes transparent after a while and you can focus on the content instead.

_Black_ makes code review faster by producing the smallest diffs possible.

Try it out now using the [Black Playground](https://black.vercel.app). Watch the
[PyCon 2019 talk](https://youtu.be/esZLCuWs_2Y) to learn more.

**[Read the documentation on ReadTheDocs!](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable)**

---

## Installation and usage

### Installation

_Black_ can be installed by running `pip install black`. It requires Python 3.7+ to run.
If you want to format Jupyter Notebooks, install with `pip install "black[jupyter]"`.

If you can't wait for the latest _hotness_ and want to install from GitHub, use:

`pip install git+https://github.com/psf/black`

### Usage

To get started right away with sensible defaults:

```sh
black {source_file_or_directory}
```

You can run _Black_ as a package if running it as a script doesn't work:

```sh
python -m black {source_file_or_directory}
```

Further information can be found in our docs:

- [Usage and Configuration](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage_and_configuration/index.html)

_Black_ is already [successfully used](https://github.com/psf/black#used-by) by many
projects, small and big. _Black_ has a comprehensive test suite, with efficient parallel
tests, and our own auto formatting and parallel Continuous Integration runner. Now that
we have become stable, you should not expect large formatting changes in the future.
Stylistic changes will mostly be responses to bug reports and support for new Python
syntax. For more information please refer to the
[The Black Code Style](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/index.html).

Also, as a safety measure which slows down processing, _Black_ will check that the
reformatted code still produces a valid AST that is effectively equivalent to the
original (see the
[Pragmatism](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html#ast-before-and-after-formatting)
section for details). If you're feeling confident, use `--fast`.

## The _Black_ code style

_Black_ is a PEP 8 compliant opinionated formatter. _Black_ reformats entire files in
place. Style configuration options are deliberately limited and rarely added. It doesn't
take previous formatting into account (see
[Pragmatism](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html#pragmatism)
for exceptions).

Our documentation covers the current _Black_ code style, but planned changes to it are
also documented. They're both worth taking a look:

- [The _Black_ Code Style: Current style](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html)
- [The _Black_ Code Style: Future style](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/future_style.html)

Changes to the _Black_ code style are bound by the Stability Policy:

- [The _Black_ Code Style: Stability Policy](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/index.html#stability-policy)

Please refer to this document before submitting an issue. What seems like a bug might be
intended behaviour.

### Pragmatism

Early versions of _Black_ used to be absolutist in some respects. They took after its
initial author. This was fine at the time as it made the implementation simpler and
there were not many users anyway. Not many edge cases were reported. As a mature tool,
_Black_ does make some exceptions to rules it otherwise holds.

- [The _Black_ code style: Pragmatism](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html#pragmatism)

Please refer to this document before submitting an issue just like with the document
above. What seems like a bug might be intended behaviour.

## Configuration

_Black_ is able to read project-specific default values for its command line options
from a `pyproject.toml` file. This is especially useful for specifying custom
`--include` and `--exclude`/`--force-exclude`/`--extend-exclude` patterns for your
project.

You can find more details in our documentation:

- [The basics: Configuration via a file](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage_and_configuration/the_basics.html#configuration-via-a-file)

And if you're looking for more general configuration documentation:

- [Usage and Configuration](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage_and_configuration/index.html)

**Pro-tip**: If you're asking yourself "Do I need to configure anything?" the answer is
"No". _Black_ is all about sensible defaults. Applying those defaults will have your
code in compliance with many other _Black_ formatted projects.

## Used by

The following notable open-source projects trust _Black_ with enforcing a consistent
code style: pytest, tox, Pyramid, Django, Django Channels, Hypothesis, attrs,
SQLAlchemy, Poetry, PyPA applications (Warehouse, Bandersnatch, Pipenv, virtualenv),
pandas, Pillow, Twisted, LocalStack, every Datadog Agent Integration, Home Assistant,
Zulip, Kedro, OpenOA, FLORIS, ORBIT, WOMBAT, and many more.

The following organizations use _Black_: Facebook, Dropbox, KeepTruckin, Mozilla, Quora,
Duolingo, QuantumBlack, Tesla, Archer Aviation.

## Testimonials

**Mike Bayer**, [author of `SQLAlchemy`](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/):

> I can't think of any single tool in my entire programming career that has given me a
> bigger productivity increase by its introduction. I can now do refactorings in about
> 1% of the keystrokes that it would have taken me previously when we had no way for
> code to format itself.

**Dusty Phillips**,
[writer](https://smile.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=dusty+phillips):

> _Black_ is opinionated so you don't have to be.

**Hynek Schlawack**, [creator of `attrs`](https://www.attrs.org/), core developer of
Twisted and CPython:

> An auto-formatter that doesn't suck is all I want for Xmas!

**Carl Meyer**, [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) core developer:

> At least the name is good.

**Kenneth Reitz**, creator of [`requests`](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
and [`pipenv`](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pipenv/):

> This vastly improves the formatting of our code. Thanks a ton!

## 23.3.0

### Highlights

This release fixes a longstanding confusing behavior in Black's GitHub action, where the
version of the action did not determine the version of Black being run (issue #3382). In
addition, there is a small bug fix around imports and a number of improvements to the
preview style.

Please try out the
[preview style](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/future_style.html#preview-style)
with `black --preview` and tell us your feedback. All changes in the preview style are
expected to become part of Black's stable style in January 2024.

### Stable style

- Import lines with `# fmt: skip` and `# fmt: off` no longer have an extra blank line
  added when they are right after another import line (#3610)

### Preview style

- Add trailing commas to collection literals even if there's a comment after the last
  entry (#3393)
- `async def`, `async for`, and `async with` statements are now formatted consistently
  compared to their non-async version. (#3609)
- `with` statements that contain two context managers will be consistently wrapped in
  parentheses (#3589)
- Let string splitters respect [East Asian Width](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr11/)
  (#3445)
- Now long string literals can be split after East Asian commas and periods (`、` U+3001
  IDEOGRAPHIC COMMA, `。` U+3002 IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP, & `，` U+FF0C FULLWIDTH COMMA)
  besides before spaces (#3445)
- For stubs, enforce one blank line after a nested class with a body other than just
  `...` (#3564)
- Improve handling of multiline strings by changing line split behavior (#1879)

### Parser

- Added support for formatting files with invalid type comments (#3594)

### Integrations

- Update GitHub Action to use the version of Black equivalent to action's version if
  version input is not specified (#3543)
- Fix missing Python binary path in autoload script for vim (#3508)

### Documentation

- Document that only the most recent release is supported for security issues;
  vulnerabilities should be reported through Tidelift (#3612)

## 23.1.0

### Highlights

This is the first release of 2023, and following our
[stability policy](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/index.html#stability-policy),
it comes with a number of improvements to our stable style, including improvements to
empty line handling, removal of redundant parentheses in several contexts, and output
that highlights implicitly concatenated strings better.

There are also many changes to the preview style; try out `black --preview` and give us
feedback to help us set the stable style for next year.

In addition to style changes, Black now automatically infers the supported Python
versions from your `pyproject.toml` file, removing the need to set Black's target
versions separately.

### Stable style

<!-- Changes that affect Black's stable style -->

- Introduce the 2023 stable style, which incorporates most aspects of last year's
  preview style (#3418). Specific changes:
  - Enforce empty lines before classes and functions with sticky leading comments
    (#3302) (22.12.0)

  - Implicitly concatenated strings used as function args are now wrapped inside
    parentheses (#3307) (22.12.0)
  - Correctly handle trailing commas that are inside a line's leading non-nested parens
    (#3370) (22.12.0)
  - `--skip-string-normalization` / `-S` now prevents docstring prefixes from being
    normalized as expected (#3168) (since 22.8.0)
  - When using `--skip-magic-trailing-comma` or `-C`, trailing commas are stripped from
    subscript expressions with more than 1 element (#3209) (22.8.0)
  - Implicitly concatenated strings inside a list, set, or tuple are now wrapped inside
    parentheses (#3162) (22.8.0)
  - Fix a string merging/split issue when a comment is present in the middle of
    implicitly concatenated strings on its own line (#3227) (22.8.0)
  - Docstring quotes are no longer moved if it would violate the line length limit
    (#3044, #3430) (22.6.0)
  - Parentheses around return annotations are now managed (#2990) (22.6.0)

### Preview style

<!-- Changes that affect Black's preview style -->

- Format hex codes in unicode escape sequences in string literals (#2916)
- Add parentheses around `if`-`else` expressions (#2278)
- Improve performance on large expressions that contain many strings (#3467)
- Fix a crash in preview style with assert + parenthesized string (#3415)
- Fix crashes in preview style with walrus operators used in function return annotations
  and except clauses (#3423)
- Fix a crash in preview advanced string processing where mixed implicitly concatenated
  regular and f-strings start with an empty span (#3463)
- Fix a crash in preview advanced string processing where a standalone comment is placed
  before a dict's value (#3469)
- Fix an issue where extra empty lines are added when a decorator has `# fmt: skip`
  applied or there is a standalone comment between decorators (#3470)
- Do not put the closing quotes in a docstring on a separate line, even if the line is
  too long (#3430)
- Long values in dict literals are now wrapped in parentheses; correspondingly
  unnecessary parentheses around short values in dict literals are now removed; long
  string lambda values are now wrapped in parentheses (#3440)

- Fix several crashes in preview style with walrus operators used in `with` statements
  or tuples (#3473)
- Fix an invalid quote escaping bug in f-string expressions where it produced invalid
  code. Implicitly concatenated f-strings with different quotes can now be merged or
  quote-normalized by changing the quotes used in expressions. (#3509)
- Fix crash on `await (yield)` when Black is compiled with mypyc (#3533)

### Configuration

<!-- Changes to how Black can be configured -->

- Black now tries to infer its `--target-version` from the project metadata specified in
  `pyproject.toml` (#3219)

### Packaging

<!-- Changes to how Black is packaged, such as dependency requirements -->

- Upgrade mypyc from `0.971` to `0.991` so mypycified _Black_ can be built on armv7
  (#3380)
  - This also fixes some crashes while using compiled Black with a debug build of
    CPython
- Drop specific support for the `tomli` requirement on 3.11 alpha releases, working
  around a bug that would cause the requirement not to be installed on any non-final
  Python releases (#3448)
- Black now depends on `packaging` version `22.0` or later. This is required for new
  functionality that needs to parse part of the project metadata (#3219)

### Output

<!-- Changes to Black's terminal output and error messages -->

- Calling `black --help` multiple times will return the same help contents each time
  (#3516)
- Verbose logging now shows the values of `pyproject.toml` configuration variables
  (#3392)
- Fix false symlink detection messages in verbose output due to using an incorrect
  relative path to the project root (#3385)

### Integrations

<!-- For example, Docker, GitHub Actions, pre-commit, editors -->

- Move 3.11 CI to normal flow now that all dependencies support 3.11 (#3446)
- Docker: Add new `latest_prerelease` tag automation to follow latest black alpha
  release on docker images (#3465)

### Documentation

<!-- Major changes to documentation and policies. Small docs changes
     don't need a changelog entry. -->

- Expand `vim-plug` installation instructions to offer more explicit options (#3468)

## 22.12.0

### Preview style

<!-- Changes that affect Black's preview style -->

- Enforce empty lines before classes and functions with sticky leading comments (#3302)
- Reformat empty and whitespace-only files as either an empty file (if no newline is
  present) or as a single newline character (if a newline is present) (#3348)
- Implicitly concatenated strings used as function args are now wrapped inside
  parentheses (#3307)
- For assignment statements, prefer splitting the right hand side if the left hand side
  fits on a single line (#3368)
- Correctly handle trailing commas that are inside a line's leading non-nested parens
  (#3370)

### Configuration

<!-- Changes to how Black can be configured -->

- Fix incorrectly applied `.gitignore` rules by considering the `.gitignore` location
  and the relative path to the target file (#3338)
- Fix incorrectly ignoring `.gitignore` presence when more than one source directory is
  specified (#3336)

### Parser

<!-- Changes to the parser or to version autodetection -->

- Parsing support has been added for walruses inside generator expression that are
  passed as function args (for example,
  `any(match := my_re.match(text) for text in texts)`) (#3327).

### Integrations

<!-- For example, Docker, GitHub Actions, pre-commit, editors -->

- Vim plugin: Optionally allow using the system installation of Black via
  `let g:black_use_virtualenv = 0`(#3309)

## 22.10.0

### Highlights

- Runtime support for Python 3.6 has been removed. Formatting 3.6 code will still be
  supported until further notice.

  (#3281)

### Preview style

- Fix a crash when formatting some dicts with parenthesis-wrapped long string keys
  (#3262)

### Configuration

- `.ipynb_checkpoints` directories are now excluded by default (#3293)
- Add `--skip-source-first-line` / `-x` option to ignore the first line of source code
  while formatting (#3299)

### Packaging

- Executables made with PyInstaller will no longer crash when formatting several files
  at once on macOS. Native x86-64 executables for macOS are available once again.
  (#3275)
- Hatchling is now used as the build backend. This will not have any effect for users
  who install Black with its wheels from PyPI. (#3233)
- Faster compiled wheels are now available for CPython 3.11 (#3276)

### _Blackd_

- Windows style (CRLF) newlines will be preserved (#3257).

### Integrations

- Vim plugin: add flag (`g:black_preview`) to enable/disable the preview style (#3246)
- Update GitHub Action to support formatting of Jupyter Notebook files via a `jupyter`
  option (#3282)
- Update GitHub Action to support use of version specifiers (e.g. `<23`) for Black
  version (#3265)

## 22.8.0

### Highlights

- Python 3.11 is now supported, except for _blackd_ as aiohttp does not support 3.11 as
  of publishing (#3234)
- This is the last release that supports running _Black_ on Python 3.6 (formatting 3.6
  code will continue to be supported until further notice)
- Reword the stability policy to say that we may, in rare cases, make changes that
  affect code that was not previously formatted by _Black_ (#3155)

### Stable style

- Fix an infinite loop when using `# fmt: on/off` in the middle of an expression or code
  block (#3158)
- Fix incorrect handling of `# fmt: skip` on colon (`:`) lines (#3148)
- Comments are no longer deleted when a line had spaces removed around power operators
  (#2874)

### Preview style

- Single-character closing docstring quotes are no longer moved to their own line as
  this is invalid. This was a bug introduced in version 22.6.0. (#3166)
- `--skip-string-normalization` / `-S` now prevents docstring prefixes from being
  normalized as expected (#3168)
- When using `--skip-magic-trailing-comma` or `-C`, trailing commas are stripped from
  subscript expressions with more than 1 element (#3209)
- Implicitly concatenated strings inside a list, set, or tuple are now wrapped inside
  parentheses (#3162)
- Fix a string merging/split issue when a comment is present in the middle of implicitly
  concatenated strings on its own line (#3227)

### _Blackd_

- `blackd` now supports enabling the preview style via the `X-Preview` header (#3217)

### Configuration

- Black now uses the presence of debug f-strings to detect target version (#3215)
- Fix misdetection of project root and verbose logging of sources in cases involving
  `--stdin-filename` (#3216)
- Immediate `.gitignore` files in source directories given on the command line are now
  also respected, previously only `.gitignore` files in the project root and
  automatically discovered directories were respected (#3237)

### Documentation

- Recommend using BlackConnect in IntelliJ IDEs (#3150)

### Integrations

- Vim plugin: prefix messages with `Black: ` so it's clear they come from Black (#3194)
- Docker: changed to a /opt/venv installation + added to PATH to be available to
  non-root users (#3202)

### Output

- Change from deprecated `asyncio.get_event_loop()` to create our event loop which
  removes DeprecationWarning (#3164)
- Remove logging from internal `blib2to3` library since it regularly emits error logs
  about failed caching that can and should be ignored (#3193)

### Parser

- Type comments are now included in the AST equivalence check consistently so accidental
  deletion raises an error. Though type comments can't be tracked when running on PyPy
  3.7 due to standard library limitations. (#2874)

### Performance

- Reduce Black's startup time when formatting a single file by 15-30% (#3211)

## 22.6.0

### Style

- Fix unstable formatting involving `#fmt: skip` and `# fmt:skip` comments (notice the
  lack of spaces) (#2970)

### Preview style

- Parentheses around return annotations are now managed (#2990)
- Remove unnecessary parentheses around awaited objects (#2991)
- Remove unnecessary parentheses in `with` statements (#2926)
- Remove trailing newlines after code block open (#3035)

### Integrations

- Add `scripts/migrate-black.py` script to ease introduction of Black to a Git project
  (#3038)

### Output

- Output Python version and implementation as part of `--version` flag (#2997)

### Packaging

- Use `tomli` instead of `tomllib` on Python 3.11 builds where `tomllib` is not
  available (#2987)

### Parser

- [PEP 654](https://peps.python.org/pep-0654/#except) syntax (for example,

  expressions (#148)

- optional parentheses are now omitted on expressions that start or end with a bracket
  and only contain a single operator (#177)

- empty parentheses in a class definition are now removed (#145, #180)

- string prefixes are now standardized to lowercase and `u` is removed on Python 3.6+
  only code and Python 2.7+ code with the `unicode_literals` future import (#188, #198,
  #199)

- typing stub files (`.pyi`) are now formatted in a style that is consistent with PEP
  484 (#207, #210)

  used (#183)

- fixed multiline strings being unnecessarily wrapped in optional parentheses in long
  assignments (#215)

- fixed not splitting long from-imports with only a single name

- fixed Python 3.6+ file discovery by also looking at function calls with unpacking.
  This fixed non-deterministic formatting if trailing commas where used both in function
  signatures with stars and function calls with stars but the former would be
  reformatted to a single line.

- fixed crash on dealing with optional parentheses (#193)

- fixed "is", "is not", "in", and "not in" not considered operators for splitting
  purposes

- fixed crash when dead symlinks where encountered

## 18.4a4

  reformatted again (#109)

- `--check` and `--diff` are no longer mutually exclusive (#149)

- generalized star expression handling, including double stars; this fixes
  multiplication making expressions "unsafe" for trailing commas (#132)

- _Black_ no longer enforces putting empty lines behind control flow statements (#90)

- _Black_ now splits imports like "Mode 3 + trailing comma" of isort (#127)

- Vim plugin now works on Windows, too

- fixed unstable formatting when encountering unnecessarily escaped quotes in a string
  (#120)

## 18.4a1

- added `--quiet` (#78)

- added automatic parentheses management (#4)

- added [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) integration (#103, #104)

- fixed reporting on `--check` with multiple files (#101, #102)

- fixed removing backslash escapes from raw strings (#100, #105)

## 18.4a0

- added `--diff` (#87)

- add line breaks before all delimiters, except in cases like commas, to better comply
  with PEP 8 (#73)

- standardize string literals to use double quotes (almost) everywhere (#75)

- fixed handling of standalone comments within nested bracketed expressions; _Black_
  will no longer produce super long lines or put all standalone comments at the end of
  the expression (#22)

- fixed 18.3a4 regression: don't crash and burn on empty lines with trailing whitespace
  (#80)

- fixed 18.3a4 regression: `# yapf: disable` usage as trailing comment would cause
  _Black_ to not emit the rest of the file (#95)

- when CTRL+C is pressed while formatting many files, _Black_ no longer freaks out with
  a flurry of asyncio-related exceptions

- only allow up to two empty lines on module level and only single empty lines within
  functions (#74)

## 18.3a4

- `# fmt: off` and `# fmt: on` are implemented (#5)

- automatic detection of deprecated Python 2 forms of print statements and exec
  statements in the formatted file (#49)

- use proper spaces for complex expressions in default values of typed function
  arguments (#60)

- only return exit code 1 when --check is used (#50)

- don't remove single trailing commas from square bracket indexing (#59)

- don't omit whitespace if the previous factor leaf wasn't a math operator (#55)

- omit extra space in kwarg unpacking if it's the first argument (#46)

- omit extra space in
  [Sphinx auto-attribute comments](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/ext/autodoc.html#directive-autoattribute)
  (#68)

## 18.3a3

- don't remove single empty lines outside of bracketed expressions (#19)

- added ability to pipe formatting from stdin to stdin (#25)

- restored ability to format code with legacy usage of `async` as a name (#20, #42)

- even better handling of numpy-style array indexing (#33, again)

## 18.3a2

- changed positioning of binary operators to occur at beginning of lines instead of at
  the end, following
  [a recent change to PEP 8](https://github.com/python/peps/commit/c59c4376ad233a62ca4b3a6060c81368bd21e85b)
  (#21)

- ignore empty bracket pairs while splitting. This avoids very weirdly looking
  formattings (#34, #35)

- remove a trailing comma if there is a single argument to a call

- if top level functions were separated by a comment, don't put four empty lines after
  the upper function

- fixed unstable formatting of newlines with imports

- fixed unintentional folding of post scriptum standalone comments into last statement
  if it was a simple statement (#18, #28)

- fixed missing space in numpy-style array indexing (#33)

- fixed spurious space after star-based unary expressions (#31)

## 18.3a1

- added `--check`

- only put trailing commas in function signatures and calls if it's safe to do so. If
  the file is Python 3.6+ it's always safe, otherwise only safe if there are no `*args`
  or `**kwargs` used in the signature or call. (#8)

- fixed invalid spacing of dots in relative imports (#6, #13)

- fixed invalid splitting after comma on unpacked variables in for-loops (#23)

- fixed spurious space in parenthesized set expressions (#7)

- fixed spurious space after opening parentheses and in default arguments (#14, #17)

- fixed spurious space after unary operators when the operand was a complex expression
  (#15)

## 18.3a0

- first published version, Happy 🍰 Day 2018!

- alpha quality

- date-versioned (see: <https://calver.org/>)
