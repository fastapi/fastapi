# This file MUST NOT contain anything but the __version__ assignment.
#
# When making a release, change the value of __version__
# to an appropriate value, and open a pull request against
# the correct branch (master if making a new feature release).
# The commit message MUST contain a properly formatted release
# log, and the commit must be signed.
#
# The release automation will: build and test the packages for the
# supported platforms, publish the packages on PyPI, merge the PR
# to the target branch, create a Git tag pointing to the commit.

__version__ = "0.5.0"
