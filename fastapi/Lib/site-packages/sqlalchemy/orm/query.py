"""The Query class and support.

Defines the :class:`_query.Query` class, the central
construct used by the ORM to construct database queries.

The :class:`_query.Query` class should not be confused with the
:class:`_expression.Select` class, which defines database
SELECT operations at the SQL (non-ORM) level.  ``Query`` differs from
``Select`` in that it returns ORM-mapped objects and interacts with an
ORM session, whereas the ``Select`` construct interacts directly with the
database to return iterable result sets.

    :class:`_query.Query`
    is the source of all SELECT statements generated by the
    ORM, both those formulated by end-user query operations as well as by
    high level internal operations such as related collection loading.  It
    features a generative interface whereby successive calls return a new
    :class:`_query.Query` object, a copy of the former with additional
    criteria and options associated with it.

    :class:`_query.Query` objects are normally initially generated using the
    :meth:`~.Session.query` method of :class:`.Session`, and in
    less common cases by instantiating the :class:`_query.Query` directly and
    associating with a :class:`.Session` using the
    :meth:`_query.Query.with_session`
    method.

    For a full walk through of :class:`_query.Query` usage, see the
    :ref:`ormtutorial_toplevel`.

        is emitted to refresh the object as well as to
        ensure that the row is still present.
        If not, :class:`~sqlalchemy.orm.exc.ObjectDeletedError` is raised.

        :meth:`_query.Query.get` is only used to return a single

         primary key.  For a composite (e.g. multiple column) primary key,
         a tuple or dictionary should be passed.

         For a single-column primary key, the scalar calling form is typically
         the most expedient.  If the primary key of a row is the value "5",
         the call looks like::

            my_object = query.get(5)

         The tuple form contains primary key values typically in

         :paramref:`_orm.Mapper.primary_key` configuration parameter were
         used, in
         the order used for that parameter. For example, if the primary key
         of a row is represented by the integer
         digits "5, 10" the call would look like::

             my_object = query.get((5, 10))

         The dictionary form should include as keys the mapped attribute names
         corresponding to each element of the primary key.  If the mapped class
         has the attributes ``id``, ``version_id`` as the attributes which
         store the object's primary key value, the call would look like::

            my_object = query.get({"id": 5, "version_id": 10})

    def from_self(self, *entities):
        r"""return a Query that selects from this Query's
        SELECT statement.

        :meth:`_query.Query.from_self` essentially turns the SELECT statement
        into a SELECT of itself.  Given a query such as::

            q = session.query(User).filter(User.name.like('e%'))

        Given the :meth:`_query.Query.from_self` version::

            q = session.query(User).filter(User.name.like('e%')).from_self()

        This query renders as:

        .. sourcecode:: sql

            SELECT anon_1.user_id AS anon_1_user_id,
                   anon_1.user_name AS anon_1_user_name
            FROM (SELECT "user".id AS user_id, "user".name AS user_name
            FROM "user"
            WHERE "user".name LIKE :name_1) AS anon_1

        There are lots of cases where :meth:`_query.Query.from_self`
        may be useful.
        A simple one is where above, we may want to apply a row LIMIT to
        the set of user objects we query against, and then apply additional
        joins against that row-limited set::

            q = session.query(User).filter(User.name.like('e%')).\
                limit(5).from_self().\
                join(User.addresses).filter(Address.email.like('q%'))

        The above query joins to the ``Address`` entity but only against the
        first five results of the ``User`` query:

        .. sourcecode:: sql

            SELECT anon_1.user_id AS anon_1_user_id,
                   anon_1.user_name AS anon_1_user_name
            FROM (SELECT "user".id AS user_id, "user".name AS user_name
            FROM "user"
            WHERE "user".name LIKE :name_1
             LIMIT :param_1) AS anon_1
            JOIN address ON anon_1.user_id = address.user_id
            WHERE address.email LIKE :email_1

        **Automatic Aliasing**

        Another key behavior of :meth:`_query.Query.from_self`
        is that it applies
        **automatic aliasing** to the entities inside the subquery, when
        they are referenced on the outside.  Above, if we continue to
        refer to the ``User`` entity without any additional aliasing applied
        to it, those references will be in terms of the subquery::

            q = session.query(User).filter(User.name.like('e%')).\
                limit(5).from_self().\
                join(User.addresses).filter(Address.email.like('q%')).\
                order_by(User.name)

        The ORDER BY against ``User.name`` is aliased to be in terms of the
        inner subquery:

        .. sourcecode:: sql

            SELECT anon_1.user_id AS anon_1_user_id,
                   anon_1.user_name AS anon_1_user_name
            FROM (SELECT "user".id AS user_id, "user".name AS user_name
            FROM "user"
            WHERE "user".name LIKE :name_1
             LIMIT :param_1) AS anon_1
            JOIN address ON anon_1.user_id = address.user_id
            WHERE address.email LIKE :email_1 ORDER BY anon_1.user_name

        The automatic aliasing feature only works in a **limited** way,
        for simple filters and orderings.   More ambitious constructions
        such as referring to the entity in joins should prefer to use
        explicit subquery objects, typically making use of the
        :meth:`_query.Query.subquery`
        method to produce an explicit subquery object.
        Always test the structure of queries by viewing the SQL to ensure
        a particular structure does what's expected!

        **Changing the Entities**

        :meth:`_query.Query.from_self`
        also includes the ability to modify what
        columns are being queried.   In our example, we want ``User.id``
        to be queried by the inner query, so that we can join to the
        ``Address`` entity on the outside, but we only wanted the outer
        query to return the ``Address.email`` column::

            q = session.query(User).filter(User.name.like('e%')).\
                limit(5).from_self(Address.email).\
                join(User.addresses).filter(Address.email.like('q%'))

        yielding:

        .. sourcecode:: sql

            SELECT address.email AS address_email
            FROM (SELECT "user".id AS user_id, "user".name AS user_name
            FROM "user"
            WHERE "user".name LIKE :name_1
             LIMIT :param_1) AS anon_1
            JOIN address ON anon_1.user_id = address.user_id
            WHERE address.email LIKE :email_1

        **Looking out for Inner / Outer Columns**

        Keep in mind that when referring to columns that originate from
        inside the subquery, we need to ensure they are present in the
        columns clause of the subquery itself; this is an ordinary aspect of
        SQL.  For example, if we wanted to load from a joined entity inside
        the subquery using :func:`.contains_eager`, we need to add those
        columns.   Below illustrates a join of ``Address`` to ``User``,
        then a subquery, and then we'd like :func:`.contains_eager` to access
        the ``User`` columns::

            q = session.query(Address).join(Address.user).\
                filter(User.name.like('e%'))

            q = q.add_entity(User).from_self().\
                options(contains_eager(Address.user))

        We use :meth:`_query.Query.add_entity` above **before** we call
        :meth:`_query.Query.from_self`
        so that the ``User`` columns are present
        in the inner subquery, so that they are available to the
        :func:`.contains_eager` modifier we are using on the outside,
        producing:

        .. sourcecode:: sql

            SELECT anon_1.address_id AS anon_1_address_id,
                   anon_1.address_email AS anon_1_address_email,
                   anon_1.address_user_id AS anon_1_address_user_id,
                   anon_1.user_id AS anon_1_user_id,
                   anon_1.user_name AS anon_1_user_name
            FROM (
                SELECT address.id AS address_id,
                address.email AS address_email,
                address.user_id AS address_user_id,
                "user".id AS user_id,
                "user".name AS user_name
            FROM address JOIN "user" ON "user".id = address.user_id
            WHERE "user".name LIKE :name_1) AS anon_1

        If we didn't call ``add_entity(User)``, but still asked
        :func:`.contains_eager` to load the ``User`` entity, it would be
        forced to add the table on the outside without the correct
        join criteria - note the ``anon1, "user"`` phrase at
        the end:

        .. sourcecode:: sql

            -- incorrect query
            SELECT anon_1.address_id AS anon_1_address_id,
                   anon_1.address_email AS anon_1_address_email,
                   anon_1.address_user_id AS anon_1_address_user_id,
                   "user".id AS user_id,
                   "user".name AS user_name
            FROM (
                SELECT address.id AS address_id,
                address.email AS address_email,
                address.user_id AS address_user_id
            FROM address JOIN "user" ON "user".id = address.user_id
            WHERE "user".name LIKE :name_1) AS anon_1, "user"

        the resulting ``SELECT`` statement will have a ``FOR UPDATE`` clause
        appended.  When additional arguments are specified, backend-specific
        options such as ``FOR UPDATE NOWAIT`` or ``LOCK IN SHARE MODE``
        can take effect.

        E.g.::

            q = sess.query(User).populate_existing().with_for_update(nowait=True, of=User)

        The above query on a PostgreSQL backend will render like::

            SELECT users.id AS users_id FROM users FOR UPDATE OF users NOWAIT

        .. warning::

            Using ``with_for_update`` in the context of eager loading
            relationships is not officially supported or recommended by
            SQLAlchemy and may not work with certain queries on various
            database backends.  When ``with_for_update`` is successfully used
            with a query that involves :func:`_orm.joinedload`, SQLAlchemy will
            attempt to emit SQL that locks all involved tables.

        .. note::  It is generally a good idea to combine the use of the
           :meth:`_orm.Query.populate_existing` method when using the
           :meth:`_orm.Query.with_for_update` method.   The purpose of
           :meth:`_orm.Query.populate_existing` is to force all the data read
           from the SELECT to be populated into the ORM objects returned,
           even if these objects are already in the :term:`identity map`.

        object's criterion

        **Simple Relationship Joins**

        Consider a mapping between two classes ``User`` and ``Address``,
        with a relationship ``User.addresses`` representing a collection
        of ``Address`` objects associated with each ``User``.   The most
        common usage of :meth:`_query.Query.join`
        is to create a JOIN along this
        relationship, using the ``User.addresses`` attribute as an indicator
        for how this should occur::

            q = session.query(User).join(User.addresses)

        Where above, the call to :meth:`_query.Query.join` along
        ``User.addresses`` will result in SQL approximately equivalent to::

            SELECT user.id, user.name
            FROM user JOIN address ON user.id = address.user_id

        In the above example we refer to ``User.addresses`` as passed to
        :meth:`_query.Query.join` as the "on clause", that is, it indicates
        how the "ON" portion of the JOIN should be constructed.

        To construct a chain of joins, multiple :meth:`_query.Query.join`
        calls may be used.  The relationship-bound attribute implies both
        the left and right side of the join at once::

            q = session.query(User).\
                    join(User.orders).\
                    join(Order.items).\
                    join(Item.keywords)

        .. note:: as seen in the above example, **the order in which each
           call to the join() method occurs is important**.    Query would not,
           for example, know how to join correctly if we were to specify
           ``User``, then ``Item``, then ``Order``, in our chain of joins; in
           such a case, depending on the arguments passed, it may raise an
           error that it doesn't know how to join, or it may produce invalid
           SQL in which case the database will raise an error. In correct
           practice, the
           :meth:`_query.Query.join` method is invoked in such a way that lines
           up with how we would want the JOIN clauses in SQL to be
           rendered, and each call should represent a clear link from what
           precedes it.

        **Joins to a Target Entity or Selectable**

        A second form of :meth:`_query.Query.join` allows any mapped entity or
        core selectable construct as a target.   In this usage,
        :meth:`_query.Query.join` will attempt to create a JOIN along the
        natural foreign key relationship between two entities::

            q = session.query(User).join(Address)

        In the above calling form, :meth:`_query.Query.join` is called upon to
        create the "on clause" automatically for us.  This calling form will
        ultimately raise an error if either there are no foreign keys between
        the two entities, or if there are multiple foreign key linkages between
        the target entity and the entity or entities already present on the
        left side such that creating a join requires more information.  Note
        that when indicating a join to a target without any ON clause, ORM
        configured relationships are not taken into account.

        **Joins to a Target with an ON Clause**

        The third calling form allows both the target entity as well
        as the ON clause to be passed explicitly.    A example that includes
        a SQL expression as the ON clause is as follows::

            q = session.query(User).join(Address, User.id==Address.user_id)

        The above form may also use a relationship-bound attribute as the
        ON clause as well::

            q = session.query(User).join(Address, User.addresses)

        The above syntax can be useful for the case where we wish
        to join to an alias of a particular target entity.  If we wanted
        to join to ``Address`` twice, it could be achieved using two
        aliases set up using the :func:`~sqlalchemy.orm.aliased` function::

            a1 = aliased(Address)
            a2 = aliased(Address)

            q = session.query(User).\
                    join(a1, User.addresses).\
                    join(a2, User.addresses).\
                    filter(a1.email_address=='ed@foo.com').\
                    filter(a2.email_address=='ed@bar.com')

        The relationship-bound calling form can also specify a target entity
        using the :meth:`_orm.PropComparator.of_type` method; a query
        equivalent to the one above would be::

            a1 = aliased(Address)
            a2 = aliased(Address)

            q = session.query(User).\
                    join(User.addresses.of_type(a1)).\
                    join(User.addresses.of_type(a2)).\
                    filter(a1.email_address == 'ed@foo.com').\
                    filter(a2.email_address == 'ed@bar.com')

        **Augmenting Built-in ON Clauses**

        As a substitute for providing a full custom ON condition for an
        existing relationship, the :meth:`_orm.PropComparator.and_` function
        may be applied to a relationship attribute to augment additional
        criteria into the ON clause; the additional criteria will be combined
        with the default criteria using AND::

            q = session.query(User).join(
                User.addresses.and_(Address.email_address != 'foo@bar.com')
            )

        .. versionadded:: 1.4

        **Joining to Tables and Subqueries**


        The target of a join may also be any table or SELECT statement,
        which may be related to a target entity or not.   Use the
        appropriate ``.subquery()`` method in order to make a subquery
        out of a query::

            subq = session.query(Address).\
                filter(Address.email_address == 'ed@foo.com').\
                subquery()


            q = session.query(User).join(
                subq, User.id == subq.c.user_id
            )

        Joining to a subquery in terms of a specific relationship and/or
        target entity may be achieved by linking the subquery to the
        entity using :func:`_orm.aliased`::

            subq = session.query(Address).\
                filter(Address.email_address == 'ed@foo.com').\
                subquery()

            address_subq = aliased(Address, subq)

            q = session.query(User).join(
                User.addresses.of_type(address_subq)
            )


        **Controlling what to Join From**

        In cases where the left side of the current state of
        :class:`_query.Query` is not in line with what we want to join from,
        the :meth:`_query.Query.select_from` method may be used::

            q = session.query(Address).select_from(User).\
                            join(User.addresses).\
                            filter(User.name == 'ed')

        Which will produce SQL similar to::

            SELECT address.* FROM user
                JOIN address ON user.id=address.user_id
                WHERE user.name = :name_1

        **Legacy Features of Query.join()**

        .. deprecated:: 1.4 The following features are deprecated and will
           be removed in SQLAlchemy 2.0.

        The :meth:`_query.Query.join` method currently supports several
        usage patterns and arguments that are considered to be legacy
        as of SQLAlchemy 1.3.   A deprecation path will follow
        in the 1.4 series for the following features:


        * Joining on relationship names rather than attributes::

            session.query(User).join("addresses")

          **Why it's legacy**: the string name does not provide enough context
          for :meth:`_query.Query.join` to always know what is desired,
          notably in that there is no indication of what the left side
          of the join should be.  This gives rise to flags like
          ``from_joinpoint`` as well as the ability to place several
          join clauses in a single :meth:`_query.Query.join` call
          which don't solve the problem fully while also
          adding new calling styles that are unnecessary and expensive to
          accommodate internally.

          **Modern calling pattern**:  Use the actual relationship,
          e.g. ``User.addresses`` in the above case::

              session.query(User).join(User.addresses)

        * Automatic aliasing with the ``aliased=True`` flag::

            session.query(Node).join(Node.children, aliased=True).\
                filter(Node.name == 'some name')

          **Why it's legacy**:  the automatic aliasing feature of
          :class:`_query.Query` is intensely complicated, both in its internal
          implementation as well as in its observed behavior, and is almost
          never used.  It is difficult to know upon inspection where and when
          its aliasing of a target entity, ``Node`` in the above case, will be
          applied and when it won't, and additionally the feature has to use
          very elaborate heuristics to achieve this implicit behavior.

          **Modern calling pattern**: Use the :func:`_orm.aliased` construct
          explicitly::

            from sqlalchemy.orm import aliased

            n1 = aliased(Node)

            session.query(Node).join(Node.children.of_type(n1)).\
                filter(n1.name == 'some name')

        * Multiple joins in one call::

            session.query(User).join("orders", "items")

            session.query(User).join(User.orders, Order.items)

            session.query(User).join(
                (Order, User.orders),
                (Item, Item.order_id == Order.id)
            )

            session.query(User).join(Order, Item)

            # ... and several more forms actually

          **Why it's legacy**: being able to chain multiple ON clauses in one
          call to :meth:`_query.Query.join` is yet another attempt to solve
          the problem of being able to specify what entity to join from,
          and is the source of a large variety of potential calling patterns
          that are internally expensive and complicated to parse and
          accommodate.

          **Modern calling pattern**:  Use relationship-bound attributes
          or SQL-oriented ON clauses within separate calls, so that
          each call to :meth:`_query.Query.join` knows what the left
          side should be::

            session.query(User).join(User.orders).join(
                Item, Item.order_id == Order.id)


        :param \*props: Incoming arguments for :meth:`_query.Query.join`,
         the props collection in modern use should be considered to be a  one
         or two argument form, either as a single "target" entity or ORM
         attribute-bound relationship, or as a target entity plus an "on
         clause" which  may be a SQL expression or ORM attribute-bound
         relationship.

        :param isouter=False: If True, the join used will be a left outer join,
         just as if the :meth:`_query.Query.outerjoin` method were called.

        :param full=False: render FULL OUTER JOIN; implies ``isouter``.

         .. versionadded:: 1.1

        :param from_joinpoint=False: When using ``aliased=True``, a setting
         of True here will cause the join to be from the most recent
         joined target, rather than starting back from the original
         FROM clauses of the query.

         .. note:: This flag is considered legacy.

        :param aliased=False: If True, indicate that the JOIN target should be
         anonymously aliased.  Subsequent calls to :meth:`_query.Query.filter`
         and similar will adapt the incoming criterion to the target
         alias, until :meth:`_query.Query.reset_joinpoint` is called.

         .. note:: This flag is considered legacy.

        .. seealso::

            :ref:`inheritance_toplevel` for details on how

        adapted to our statement, even in the case of the WHERE clause:

        .. sourcecode:: sql

            SELECT anon_1.id AS anon_1_id, anon_1.name AS anon_1_name
            FROM (SELECT "user".id AS id, "user".name AS name
            FROM "user"
            WHERE "user".id = :id_1) AS anon_1
            WHERE anon_1.name = :name_1

        The :meth:`_query.Query.select_entity_from` method is similar to the
        :meth:`_query.Query.select_from` method,
        in that it sets the FROM clause
        of the query.  The difference is that it additionally applies
        adaptation to the other parts of the query that refer to the
        primary entity.  If above we had used :meth:`_query.Query.select_from`
        instead, the SQL generated would have been:

        .. sourcecode:: sql

            -- uses plain select_from(), not select_entity_from()
            SELECT "user".id AS user_id, "user".name AS user_name
            FROM "user", (SELECT "user".id AS id, "user".name AS name
            FROM "user"
            WHERE "user".id = :id_1) AS anon_1
            WHERE "user".name = :name_1

        To supply textual SQL to the :meth:`_query.Query.select_entity_from`
        method,
        we can make use of the :func:`_expression.text` construct.  However,
        the
        :func:`_expression.text`
        construct needs to be aligned with the columns of our
        entity, which is achieved by making use of the
        :meth:`_expression.TextClause.columns` method::

            text_stmt = text("select id, name from user").columns(
                User.id, User.name).subquery()
            q = session.query(User).select_entity_from(text_stmt)

        :meth:`_query.Query.select_entity_from` itself accepts an
        :func:`.aliased`
        object, so that the special options of :func:`.aliased` such as
        :paramref:`.aliased.adapt_on_names` may be used within the
        scope of the :meth:`_query.Query.select_entity_from`
        method's adaptation
        services.  Suppose
        a view ``user_view`` also returns rows from ``user``.    If
        we reflect this view into a :class:`_schema.Table`, this view has no
        relationship to the :class:`_schema.Table` to which we are mapped,
        however
        we can use name matching to select from it::

            user_view = Table('user_view', metadata,
                              autoload_with=engine)
            user_view_alias = aliased(
                User, user_view, adapt_on_names=True)
            q = session.query(User).\
                select_entity_from(user_view_alias).\
                order_by(User.name)

        .. versionchanged:: 1.1.7 The :meth:`_query.Query.select_entity_from`
           method now accepts an :func:`.aliased` object as an alternative
           to a :class:`_expression.FromClause` object.

        :param from_obj: a :class:`_expression.FromClause`
         object that will replace
         the FROM clause of this :class:`_query.Query`.

            It is important to note that the value returned by
            count() is **not the same as the number of ORM objects that this
            Query would return from a method such as the .all() method**.
            The :class:`_query.Query` object,
            when asked to return full entities,
            will **deduplicate entries based on primary key**, meaning if the
            same primary key value would appear in the results more than once,
            only one object of that primary key would be present.  This does
            not apply to a query that is against individual columns.
