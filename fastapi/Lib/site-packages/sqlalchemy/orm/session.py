        See also the :class:`.sessionmaker` function which is used to
        generate a :class:`.Session`-producing callable with a given
        set of arguments.

        :param autocommit:
          Defaults to ``False``. When ``True``, the
          :class:`.Session` does not automatically begin transactions for
          individual statement executions, will acquire connections from the
          engine on an as-needed basis, releasing to the connection pool
          after each statement. Flushes will begin and commit (or possibly
          rollback) their own transaction if no transaction is present.
          When using this mode, the
          :meth:`.Session.begin` method may be used to explicitly start
          transactions, but the usual "autobegin" behavior is not present.

        :param autoflush: When ``True``, all query operations will issue a
           :meth:`~.Session.flush` call to this ``Session`` before proceeding.
           This is a convenience feature so that :meth:`~.Session.flush` need
           not be called repeatedly in order for database queries to retrieve
           results. It's typical that ``autoflush`` is used in conjunction
           with ``autocommit=False``. In this scenario, explicit calls to
           :meth:`~.Session.flush` are rarely needed; you usually only need to
           call :meth:`~.Session.commit` (which flushes) to finalize changes.

           .. seealso::

               :ref:`session_flushing` - additional background on autoflush

        :param bind: An optional :class:`_engine.Engine` or
           :class:`_engine.Connection` to
           which this ``Session`` should be bound. When specified, all SQL
           operations performed by this session will execute via this
           connectable.

        :param binds: A dictionary which may specify any number of
           :class:`_engine.Engine` or :class:`_engine.Connection`
           objects as the source of
           connectivity for SQL operations on a per-entity basis.   The keys
           of the dictionary consist of any series of mapped classes,
           arbitrary Python classes that are bases for mapped classes,
           :class:`_schema.Table` objects and :class:`_orm.Mapper` objects.
           The
           values of the dictionary are then instances of
           :class:`_engine.Engine`
           or less commonly :class:`_engine.Connection` objects.
           Operations which
           proceed relative to a particular mapped class will consult this
           dictionary for the closest matching entity in order to determine
           which :class:`_engine.Engine` should be used for a particular SQL
           operation.    The complete heuristics for resolution are
           described at :meth:`.Session.get_bind`.  Usage looks like::

            Session = sessionmaker(binds={
                SomeMappedClass: create_engine('postgresql://engine1'),
                SomeDeclarativeBase: create_engine('postgresql://engine2'),
                some_mapper: create_engine('postgresql://engine3'),
                some_table: create_engine('postgresql://engine4'),

                :meth:`.Session.get_bind`


        :param \class_: Specify an alternate class other than
           ``sqlalchemy.orm.session.Session`` which should be used by the
           returned class. This is the only argument that is local to the
           :class:`.sessionmaker` function, and is not sent directly to the
           constructor for ``Session``.

        :param enable_baked_queries: defaults to ``True``.  A flag consumed
           by the :mod:`sqlalchemy.ext.baked` extension to determine if
           "baked queries" should be cached, as is the normal operation
           of this extension.  When set to ``False``, caching as used by
           this particular extension is disabled.

           .. versionchanged:: 1.4 The ``sqlalchemy.ext.baked`` extension is
              legacy and is not used by any of SQLAlchemy's internals. This
              flag therefore only affects applications that are making explicit
              use of this extension within their own code.

        :param expire_on_commit:  Defaults to ``True``. When ``True``, all
           instances will be fully expired after each :meth:`~.commit`,
           so that all attribute/object access subsequent to a completed
           transaction will load from the most recent database state.

        :param future: if True, use 2.0 style transactional and engine
          behavior.  Future mode includes the following behaviors:

          * The :class:`_orm.Session` will not use "bound" metadata in order
            to locate an :class:`_engine.Engine`; the engine or engines in use
            must be specified to the constructor of :class:`_orm.Session` or
            otherwise be configured against the :class:`_orm.sessionmaker`
            in use

          * The "subtransactions" feature of :meth:`_orm.Session.begin` is
            removed in version 2.0 and is disabled when the future flag is
            set.

          * The behavior of the :paramref:`_orm.relationship.cascade_backrefs`

           is raised.

        Note that the :meth:`.Session.get_bind` method can be overridden on

        .. versionadded:: 1.4 Added :meth:`_orm.Session.get`, which is moved
           from the now deprecated :meth:`_orm.Query.get` method.

        :meth:`_orm.Session.get` is special in that it provides direct
        access to the identity map of the :class:`.Session`.
        If the given primary key identifier is present
        in the local identity map, the object is returned
        directly from this collection and no SQL is emitted,
        unless the object has been marked fully expired.
        If not present,
        a SELECT is performed in order to locate the object.

        :meth:`_orm.Session.get` also will perform a check if
        the object is present in the identity map and
        marked as expired - a SELECT
        is emitted to refresh the object as well as to
        ensure that the row is still present.
        If not, :class:`~sqlalchemy.orm.exc.ObjectDeletedError` is raised.

        :param entity: a mapped class or :class:`.Mapper` indicating the
         type of entity to be loaded.

        :param ident: A scalar, tuple, or dictionary representing the
         primary key.  For a composite (e.g. multiple column) primary key,
         a tuple or dictionary should be passed.

         For a single-column primary key, the scalar calling form is typically
         the most expedient.  If the primary key of a row is the value "5",
         the call looks like::

            my_object = session.get(SomeClass, 5)

         The tuple form contains primary key values typically in
         the order in which they correspond to the mapped
         :class:`_schema.Table`
         object's primary key columns, or if the
         :paramref:`_orm.Mapper.primary_key` configuration parameter were
         used, in
         the order used for that parameter. For example, if the primary key
         of a row is represented by the integer
         digits "5, 10" the call would look like::

             my_object = session.get(SomeClass, (5, 10))

         The dictionary form should include as keys the mapped attribute names
         corresponding to each element of the primary key.  If the mapped class
         has the attributes ``id``, ``version_id`` as the attributes which
         store the object's primary key value, the call would look like::

            my_object = session.get(SomeClass, {"id": 5, "version_id": 10})

        :param options: optional sequence of loader options which will be
         applied to the query, if one is emitted.

        :param populate_existing: causes the method to unconditionally emit
         a SQL query and refresh the object with the newly loaded data,
         regardless of whether or not the object is already present.

        :param with_for_update: optional boolean ``True`` indicating FOR UPDATE
          should be used, or may be a dictionary containing flags to
          indicate a more specific set of FOR UPDATE flags for the SELECT;
          flags should match the parameters of
          :meth:`_query.Query.with_for_update`.
          Supersedes the :paramref:`.Session.refresh.lockmode` parameter.

        :param execution_options: optional dictionary of execution options,
         which will be associated with the query execution if one is emitted.
         This dictionary can provide a subset of the options that are
         accepted by :meth:`_engine.Connection.execution_options`, and may
         also provide additional options understood only in an ORM context.

        :meth:`.Session.merge` examines the primary key attributes of the
        source instance, and attempts to reconcile it with an instance of the
        same primary key in the session.   If not found locally, it attempts
        to load the object from the database based on primary key, and if
        none can be located, creates a new instance.  The state of each
        attribute on the source instance is then copied to the target
        instance.  The resulting target instance is then returned by the
        method; the original source instance is left unmodified, and
        un-associated with the :class:`.Session` if not already.

        This operation cascades to associated instances if the association is
        mapped with ``cascade="merge"``.

        See :ref:`unitofwork_merging` for a detailed discussion of merging.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.1 - :meth:`.Session.merge` will now reconcile
           pending objects with overlapping primary keys in the same way
           as persistent.  See :ref:`change_3601` for discussion.

        :param instance: Instance to be merged.
        :param load: Boolean, when False, :meth:`.merge` switches into
         a "high performance" mode which causes it to forego emitting history
         events as well as all database access.  This flag is used for
         cases such as transferring graphs of objects into a :class:`.Session`
         from a second level cache, or to transfer just-loaded objects
         into the :class:`.Session` owned by a worker thread or process
         without re-querying the database.

         The ``load=False`` use case adds the caveat that the given
         object has to be in a "clean" state, that is, has no pending changes
         to be flushed - even if the incoming object is detached from any
         :class:`.Session`.   This is so that when
         the merge operation populates local attributes and
         cascades to related objects and
         collections, the values can be "stamped" onto the
         target object as is, without generating any history or attribute
         events, and without the need to reconcile the incoming data with
         any existing related objects or collections that might not
         be loaded.  The resulting objects from ``load=False`` are always
         produced as "clean", so it is only appropriate that the given objects
         should be "clean" as well, else this suggests a mis-use of the
         method.

            :meth:`.enable_relationship_loading` exists to serve special
            use cases and is not recommended for general use.

        Accesses of attributes mapped with :func:`_orm.relationship`
        will attempt to load a value from the database using this
        :class:`.Session` as the source of connectivity.  The values
        will be loaded based on foreign key and primary key values
        present on this object - if not present, then those relationships
        will be unavailable.

        The object will be attached to this session, but will
        **not** participate in any persistence operations; its state
        for almost all purposes will remain either "transient" or
        "detached", except for the case of relationship loading.

        Also note that backrefs will often not work as expected.
        Altering a relationship-bound attribute on the target object
        may not fire off a backref event, if the effective value
        is what was already loaded from a foreign-key-holding value.

        The :meth:`.Session.enable_relationship_loading` method is
        similar to the ``load_on_pending`` flag on :func:`_orm.relationship`.
        Unlike that flag, :meth:`.Session.enable_relationship_loading` allows
        an object to remain transient while still being able to load
        related items.

        To make a transient object associated with a :class:`.Session`
        via :meth:`.Session.enable_relationship_loading` pending, add
        it to the :class:`.Session` using :meth:`.Session.add` normally.
        If the object instead represents an existing identity in the database,
        it should be merged using :meth:`.Session.merge`.

        :meth:`.Session.enable_relationship_loading` does not improve
        behavior when the ORM is used normally - object references should be
        constructed at the object level, not at the foreign key level, so
        that they are present in an ordinary way before flush()
        proceeds.  This method is not intended for general use.

        .. seealso::

            :paramref:`_orm.relationship.load_on_pending` - this flag
            allows per-relationship loading of many-to-ones on items that
            are pending.

            :func:`.make_transient_to_detached` - allows for an object to
            be added to a :class:`.Session` without SQL emitted, which then
            will unexpire attributes on access.

        grouped together into higher performing "executemany"
        operations; the extraction of data from the objects is also performed
        using a lower-latency process that ignores whether or not attributes
        have actually been modified in the case of UPDATEs, and also ignores
        SQL expressions.

        The objects as given are not added to the session and no additional
        state is established on them. If the
        :paramref:`_orm.Session.bulk_save_objects.return_defaults` flag is set,
        then server-generated primary key values will be assigned to the
        returned objects, but **not server side defaults**; this is a
        limitation in the implementation. If stateful objects are desired,

        :ref:`orm_dml_returning_objects`.

            The bulk save feature allows for a lower-latency INSERT/UPDATE
            of rows at the expense of most other unit-of-work features.
            Features such as object management, relationship handling,
            and SQL clause support are **silently omitted** in favor of raw
            INSERT/UPDATES of records.

            Please note that newer versions of SQLAlchemy are **greatly
            improving the efficiency** of the standard flush process. It is
            **strongly recommended** to not use the bulk methods as they
            represent a forking of SQLAlchemy's functionality and are slowly
            being moved into legacy status.  New features such as
            :ref:`orm_dml_returning_objects` are both more efficient than
            the "bulk" methods and provide more predictable functionality.

         objects are persisted as is, and are **not** associated with the
         :class:`.Session` afterwards.

         For each object, whether the object is sent as an INSERT or an
         UPDATE is dependent on the same rules used by the :class:`.Session`
         in traditional operation; if the object has the
         :attr:`.InstanceState.key`
         attribute set, then the object is assumed to be "detached" and
         will result in an UPDATE.  Otherwise, an INSERT is used.

         In the case of an UPDATE, statements are grouped based on which
         attributes have changed, and are thus to be the subject of each
         SET clause.  If ``update_changed_only`` is False, then all
         attributes present within each object are applied to the UPDATE
         statement, which may help in allowing the statements to be grouped
         together into a larger executemany(), and will also reduce the
         overhead of checking history on attributes.

        :param return_defaults: when True, rows that are missing values which
         generate defaults, namely integer primary key defaults and sequences,

         is available.  In particular this will allow joined-inheritance
         and other multi-table mappings to insert correctly without the need
         to provide primary key values ahead of time; however,
         :paramref:`.Session.bulk_save_objects.return_defaults` **greatly
         reduces the performance gains** of the method overall.  It is strongly

         approach.

        :param update_changed_only: when True, UPDATE statements are rendered
         based on those attributes in each state that have logged changes.
         When False, all attributes present are rendered into the SET clause
         with the exception of primary key attributes.

        :param preserve_order: when True, the order of inserts and updates
         matches exactly the order in which the objects are given.   When
         False, common types of objects are grouped into inserts
         and updates, to allow for more batching opportunities.

        This method retrieves the history for each instrumented
        attribute on the instance and performs a comparison of the current
        value to its previously committed value, if any.

        It is in effect a more expensive and accurate
        version of checking for the given instance in the
        :attr:`.Session.dirty` collection; a full test for
        each attribute's net "dirty" status is performed.

        E.g.::

            return session.is_modified(someobject)

        A few caveats to this method apply:

        * Instances present in the :attr:`.Session.dirty` collection may
          report ``False`` when tested with this method.  This is because
          the object may have received change events via attribute mutation,
          thus placing it in :attr:`.Session.dirty`, but ultimately the state
          is the same as that loaded from the database, resulting in no net
          change here.
        * Scalar attributes may not have recorded the previously set
          value when a new value was applied, if the attribute was not loaded,
          or was expired, at the time the new value was received - in these
          cases, the attribute is assumed to have a change, even if there is
          ultimately no net change against its database value. SQLAlchemy in
          most cases does not need the "old" value when a set event occurs, so
          it skips the expense of a SQL call if the old value isn't present,
          based on the assumption that an UPDATE of the scalar value is
          usually needed, and in those few cases where it isn't, is less
          expensive on average than issuing a defensive SELECT.

          The "old" value is fetched unconditionally upon set only if the
          attribute container has the ``active_history`` flag set to ``True``.
          This flag is set typically for primary key attributes and scalar
          object references that are not a simple many-to-one.  To set this
          flag for any arbitrary mapped column, use the ``active_history``
          argument with :func:`.column_property`.

        :param instance: mapped instance to be tested for pending changes.
        :param include_collections: Indicates if multivalued collections
         should be included in the operation.  Setting this to ``False`` is a
         way to detect only local-column based properties (i.e. scalar columns

         instance upon flush.

    :class:`_engine.Engine` to produce a :class:`_orm.Session` that is instead
    bound to a specific :class:`_engine.Connection` procured from that engine::

        Session = sessionmaker(engine)

        # bind an individual session to a connection

        with engine.connect() as connection:
            with Session(bind=connection) as session:
                # work with session

    The class also includes a method :meth:`_orm.sessionmaker.configure`, which
    can be used to specify additional keyword arguments to the factory, which
    will take effect for subsequent :class:`.Session` objects generated. This
    is usually used to associate one or more :class:`_engine.Engine` objects
    with an existing
    :class:`.sessionmaker` factory before it is first used::

        # application starts, sessionmaker does not have
        # an engine bound yet
        Session = sessionmaker()

        # ... later, when an engine URL is read from a configuration
        # file or other events allow the engine to be created
        engine = create_engine('sqlite:///foo.db')
        Session.configure(bind=engine)

        sess = Session()
        # work with session

    The given mapped instance is assumed to be in the :term:`persistent` or
    :term:`detached` state.   The function will remove its association with any
    :class:`.Session` as well as its :attr:`.InstanceState.identity`. The

        * were expired via :meth:`.Session.expire`

        * were expired as the natural effect of committing a session

        * are "deferred" via :ref:`deferred` and are not yet loaded

          which is common in joined table inheritance and other scenarios.

        After :func:`.make_transient` is called, unloaded attributes such
        as those above will normally resolve to the value ``None`` when
        accessed, or an empty collection for a collection-oriented attribute.
