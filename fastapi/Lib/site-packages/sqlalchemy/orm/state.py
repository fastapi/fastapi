    The :class:`.InstanceState` is a key object used by the
    SQLAlchemy ORM in order to track the state of an object;
    it is created the moment an object is instantiated, typically
    as a result of :term:`instrumentation` which SQLAlchemy applies
    to the ``__init__()`` method of the class.

    :class:`.InstanceState` is also a semi-public object,
    available for runtime inspection as to the state of a
    mapped instance, including information such as its current
    status within a particular :class:`.Session` and details
    about data on individual attributes.  The public API
    in order to acquire a :class:`.InstanceState` object
    is to use the :func:`_sa.inspect` system::
