class PropComparator(operators.ColumnOperators):
    r"""Defines SQL operators for :class:`.MapperProperty` objects.

    SQLAlchemy allows for operators to
    be redefined at both the Core and ORM level.  :class:`.PropComparator`
    is the base class of operator redefinition for ORM-level operations,
    including those of :class:`.ColumnProperty`,
    :class:`.RelationshipProperty`, and :class:`.CompositeProperty`.

    .. note:: With the advent of Hybrid properties introduced in SQLAlchemy
       0.7, as well as Core-level operator redefinition in
       SQLAlchemy 0.8, the use case for user-defined :class:`.PropComparator`
       instances is extremely rare.  See :ref:`hybrids_toplevel` as well
       as :ref:`types_operators`.

    User-defined subclasses of :class:`.PropComparator` may be created. The
    built-in Python comparison and math operator methods, such as
    :meth:`.operators.ColumnOperators.__eq__`,
    :meth:`.operators.ColumnOperators.__lt__`, and
    :meth:`.operators.ColumnOperators.__add__`, can be overridden to provide
    new operator behavior. The custom :class:`.PropComparator` is passed to
    the :class:`.MapperProperty` instance via the ``comparator_factory``
    argument. In each case,
    the appropriate subclass of :class:`.PropComparator` should be used::

        loader strategy being asked to load related rows on behalf of that
        cached query, which is assumed to be building a new query based on
        entities passed to us from the cached query.

        Currently this routine chooses between "self" and "uncached" without
        manufacturing anything new. If the option is itself a loader strategy
        option which has a path, that path needs to match to the entities being
        passed to us by the cached query, so the :class:`_orm.Load` subclass
        overrides this to return "self". For all other options, we return the
        uncached form which may have changing state, such as a
        with_loader_criteria() option which will very often have new state.

        This routine could in the future involve
        generating a new option based on both inputs if use cases arise,
        such as if with_loader_criteria() needed to match up to
        ``AliasedClass`` instances given in the parent query.

        However, longer term it might be better to restructure things such that
        ``AliasedClass`` entities are always matched up on their cache key,
        instead of identity, in things like paths and such, so that this whole
        issue of "the uncached option does not match the entities" goes away.
        However this would make ``PathRegistry`` more complicated and difficult
        to debug as well as potentially less performant in that it would be
        hashing enormous cache keys rather than a simple AliasedInsp. UNLESS,
        we could get cache keys overall to be reliably hashed into something
        like an md5 key.
