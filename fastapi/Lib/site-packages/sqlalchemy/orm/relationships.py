        This corresponds to a parent-child or associative table relationship.
        The constructed class is an instance of
        :class:`.RelationshipProperty`.

        A typical :func:`_orm.relationship`, used in a classical mapping::

           mapper(Parent, properties={
             'children': relationship(Child)
           })

        Some arguments accepted by :func:`_orm.relationship`
        optionally accept a
        callable function, which when called produces the desired value.
        The callable is invoked by the parent :class:`_orm.Mapper` at "mapper
        initialization" time, which happens only when mappers are first used,
        and is assumed to be after all mappings have been constructed.  This
        can be used to resolve order-of-declaration and other dependency
        issues, such as if ``Child`` is declared below ``Parent`` in the same
        file::

            mapper(Parent, properties={
                "children":relationship(lambda: Child,
                                    order_by=lambda: Child.id)
            })

        When using the :ref:`declarative_toplevel` extension, the Declarative
        initializer allows string arguments to be passed to
        :func:`_orm.relationship`.  These string arguments are converted into
        callables that evaluate the string as Python code, using the
        Declarative class-registry as a namespace.  This allows the lookup of
        related classes to be automatic via their string name, and removes the
        need for related classes to be imported into the local module space
        before the dependent classes have been declared.  It is still required
        that the modules in which these related classes appear are imported
        anywhere in the application at some point before the related mappings
        are actually used, else a lookup error will be raised when the
        :func:`_orm.relationship`
        attempts to resolve the string reference to the
        related class.    An example of a string- resolved class is as
        follows::

            from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

            Base = declarative_base()

            class Parent(Base):
                __tablename__ = 'parent'
                id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
                children = relationship("Child", order_by="Child.id")

          reference documentation for :func:`_orm.relationship`.

          :ref:`tutorial_orm_related_objects` - ORM tutorial introduction.

        :param argument:
          A mapped class, or actual :class:`_orm.Mapper` instance,
          representing
          the target of the relationship.

          :paramref:`_orm.relationship.argument`
          may also be passed as a callable
          function which is evaluated at mapper initialization time, and may
          be passed as a string name when using Declarative.

          .. warning:: Prior to SQLAlchemy 1.3.16, this value is interpreted
             using Python's ``eval()`` function.
             **DO NOT PASS UNTRUSTED INPUT TO THIS STRING**.
             See :ref:`declarative_relationship_eval` for details on
             declarative evaluation of :func:`_orm.relationship` arguments.

          .. versionchanged 1.3.16::

             The string evaluation of the main "argument" no longer accepts an
             open ended Python expression, instead only accepting a string
             class name or dotted package-qualified name.

          .. seealso::

            :ref:`declarative_configuring_relationships` - further detail
            on relationship configuration when using Declarative.

        :param secondary:
          For a many-to-many relationship, specifies the intermediary
          table, and is typically an instance of :class:`_schema.Table`.
          In less common circumstances, the argument may also be specified
          as an :class:`_expression.Alias` construct, or even a
          :class:`_expression.Join` construct.

          :paramref:`_orm.relationship.secondary` may
          also be passed as a callable function which is evaluated at
          mapper initialization time.  When using Declarative, it may also
          be a string argument noting the name of a :class:`_schema.Table`
          that is
          present in the :class:`_schema.MetaData`
          collection associated with the
          parent-mapped :class:`_schema.Table`.

          .. warning:: When passed as a Python-evaluable string, the
             argument is interpreted using Python's ``eval()`` function.
             **DO NOT PASS UNTRUSTED INPUT TO THIS STRING**.
             See :ref:`declarative_relationship_eval` for details on
             declarative evaluation of :func:`_orm.relationship` arguments.

          The :paramref:`_orm.relationship.secondary` keyword argument is
          typically applied in the case where the intermediary
          :class:`_schema.Table`
          is not otherwise expressed in any direct class mapping. If the
          "secondary" table is also explicitly mapped elsewhere (e.g. as in
          :ref:`association_pattern`), one should consider applying the
          :paramref:`_orm.relationship.viewonly` flag so that this
          :func:`_orm.relationship`
          is not used for persistence operations which
          may conflict with those of the association object pattern.

              Declarative.

              :ref:`association_pattern` - an alternative to
              :paramref:`_orm.relationship.secondary`
              when composing association
              table relationships, allowing additional attributes to be
              specified on the association table.

              :ref:`composite_secondary_join` - a lesser-used pattern which
              in some cases can enable complex :func:`_orm.relationship` SQL
              conditions to be used.

          .. versionadded:: 0.9.2 :paramref:`_orm.relationship.secondary`
             works
             more effectively when referring to a :class:`_expression.Join`
             instance.

        :param active_history=False:
          When ``True``, indicates that the "previous" value for a
          many-to-one reference should be loaded when replaced, if
          not already loaded. Normally, history tracking logic for
          simple many-to-ones only needs to be aware of the "new"
          value in order to perform a flush. This flag is available
          for applications that make use of
          :func:`.attributes.get_history` which also need to know
          the "previous" value of the attribute.

        :param backref:
          A reference to a string relationship name, or a :func:`_orm.backref`
          construct, which will be used to automatically generate a new
          :func:`_orm.relationship` on the related class, which then refers to
          this one using a bi-directional
          :paramref:`_orm.relationship.back_populates` configuration.

          In modern Python, explicit use of :func:`_orm.relationship` with
          :paramref:`_orm.relationship.back_populates` should be preferred, as
          it is more robust in terms of mapper configuration as well as more
          conceptually straightforward. It also integrates with new :pep:`484`
          typing features introduced in SQLAlchemy 2.0 which is not possible
          with dynamically generated attributes.

              :func:`.backref` - allows control over :func:`_orm.relationship`
              configuration when using :paramref:`_orm.relationship.backref`.


        :param back_populates:
          Indicates the name of a :func:`_orm.relationship` on the related
          class that will be synchronized with this one.   It is usually
          expected that the :func:`_orm.relationship` on the related class
          also refer to this one.  This allows objects on both sides of
          each :func:`_orm.relationship` to synchronize in-Python state
          changes and also provides directives to the :term:`unit of work`
          flush process how changes along these relationships should
          be persisted.

              :ref:`relationship_patterns` - includes many examples of
              :paramref:`_orm.relationship.back_populates`.

        :param overlaps:
           A string name or comma-delimited set of names of other relationships
           on either this mapper, a descendant mapper, or a target mapper with
           which this relationship may write to the same foreign keys upon
           persistence.   The only effect this has is to eliminate the
           warning that this relationship will conflict with another upon
           persistence.   This is used for such relationships that are truly
           capable of conflicting with each other on write, but the application
           will ensure that no such conflicts occur.

                :ref:`error_qzyx` - usage example

        :param bake_queries=True:
          Legacy parameter, not used.

          .. versionchanged:: 1.4.23 the "lambda caching" system is no longer
             used by loader strategies and the ``bake_queries`` parameter
             has no effect.

        :param cascade:
          A comma-separated list of cascade rules which determines how
          Session operations should be "cascaded" from parent to child.
          This defaults to ``False``, which means the default cascade
          should be used - this default cascade is ``"save-update, merge"``.

          The available cascades are ``save-update``, ``merge``,
          ``expunge``, ``delete``, ``delete-orphan``, and ``refresh-expire``.
          An additional option, ``all`` indicates shorthand for
          ``"save-update, merge, refresh-expire,
          expunge, delete"``, and is often used as in ``"all, delete-orphan"``
          to indicate that related objects should follow along with the
          parent object in all cases, and be deleted when de-associated.

          .. seealso::

            :ref:`unitofwork_cascades` - Full detail on each of the available
            cascade options.

        :param cascade_backrefs=True:
          A boolean value indicating if the ``save-update`` cascade should
          operate along an assignment event intercepted by a backref.
          When set to ``False``, the attribute managed by this relationship
          will not cascade an incoming transient object into the session of a
          persistent parent, if the event is received via backref.

          .. deprecated:: 1.4 The
             :paramref:`_orm.relationship.cascade_backrefs`
             flag will default to False in all cases in SQLAlchemy 2.0.

          A class or callable that returns a new list-holding object. will
          be used in place of a plain list for storing elements.

          .. seealso::

            :ref:`custom_collections` - Introductory documentation and
            examples.

        :param comparator_factory:
          A class which extends :class:`.RelationshipProperty.Comparator`
          which provides custom SQL clause generation for comparison
          operations.

          .. seealso::

            at this level.

            :ref:`custom_comparators` - Brief intro to this feature.


        :param distinct_target_key=None:
          Indicate if a "subquery" eager load should apply the DISTINCT
          keyword to the innermost SELECT statement.  When left as ``None``,
          the DISTINCT keyword will be applied in those cases when the target
          columns do not comprise the full primary key of the target table.
          When set to ``True``, the DISTINCT keyword is applied to the
          innermost SELECT unconditionally.

          It may be desirable to set this flag to False when the DISTINCT is
          reducing performance of the innermost subquery beyond that of what
          duplicate innermost rows may be causing.

          .. versionchanged:: 0.9.0 -
             :paramref:`_orm.relationship.distinct_target_key` now defaults to
             ``None``, so that the feature enables itself automatically for
             those cases where the innermost query targets a non-unique
             key.

          .. seealso::

            :ref:`loading_toplevel` - includes an introduction to subquery
            eager loading.

        :param doc:
          Docstring which will be applied to the resulting descriptor.

        :param foreign_keys:

          A list of columns which are to be used as "foreign key"
          columns, or columns which refer to the value in a remote
          column, within the context of this :func:`_orm.relationship`
          object's :paramref:`_orm.relationship.primaryjoin` condition.
          That is, if the :paramref:`_orm.relationship.primaryjoin`
          condition of this :func:`_orm.relationship` is ``a.id ==
          b.a_id``, and the values in ``b.a_id`` are required to be
          present in ``a.id``, then the "foreign key" column of this
          :func:`_orm.relationship` is ``b.a_id``.

          In normal cases, the :paramref:`_orm.relationship.foreign_keys`
          parameter is **not required.** :func:`_orm.relationship` will
          automatically determine which columns in the
          :paramref:`_orm.relationship.primaryjoin` condition are to be
          considered "foreign key" columns based on those
          :class:`_schema.Column` objects that specify
          :class:`_schema.ForeignKey`,
          or are otherwise listed as referencing columns in a
          :class:`_schema.ForeignKeyConstraint` construct.
          :paramref:`_orm.relationship.foreign_keys` is only needed when:

            1. There is more than one way to construct a join from the local
               table to the remote table, as there are multiple foreign key
               references present.  Setting ``foreign_keys`` will limit the
               :func:`_orm.relationship`
               to consider just those columns specified
               here as "foreign".

            2. The :class:`_schema.Table` being mapped does not actually have
               :class:`_schema.ForeignKey` or
               :class:`_schema.ForeignKeyConstraint`
               constructs present, often because the table
               was reflected from a database that does not support foreign key
               reflection (MySQL MyISAM).

            3. The :paramref:`_orm.relationship.primaryjoin`
               argument is used to
               construct a non-standard join condition, which makes use of
               columns or expressions that do not normally refer to their
               "parent" column, such as a join condition expressed by a
               complex comparison using a SQL function.

          The :func:`_orm.relationship` construct will raise informative
          error messages that suggest the use of the
          :paramref:`_orm.relationship.foreign_keys` parameter when
          presented with an ambiguous condition.   In typical cases,
          if :func:`_orm.relationship` doesn't raise any exceptions, the
          :paramref:`_orm.relationship.foreign_keys` parameter is usually
          not needed.

          :paramref:`_orm.relationship.foreign_keys` may also be passed as a
          callable function which is evaluated at mapper initialization time,
          and may be passed as a Python-evaluable string when using
          Declarative.

          .. warning:: When passed as a Python-evaluable string, the
             argument is interpreted using Python's ``eval()`` function.

        :param innerjoin=False:
          When ``True``, joined eager loads will use an inner join to join
          against related tables instead of an outer join.  The purpose
          of this option is generally one of performance, as inner joins
          generally perform better than outer joins.

          This flag can be set to ``True`` when the relationship references an
          object via many-to-one using local foreign keys that are not
          nullable, or when the reference is one-to-one or a collection that
          is guaranteed to have one or at least one entry.

          The option supports the same "nested" and "unnested" options as
          that of :paramref:`_orm.joinedload.innerjoin`.  See that flag
          for details on nested / unnested behaviors.

        :param join_depth:
          When non-``None``, an integer value indicating how many levels
          deep "eager" loaders should join on a self-referring or cyclical
          relationship.  The number counts how many times the same Mapper
          shall be present in the loading condition along a particular join
          branch.  When left at its default of ``None``, eager loaders
          will stop chaining when they encounter a the same target mapper
          which is already higher up in the chain.  This option applies
          both to joined- and subquery- eager loaders.

        :param lazy='select': specifies
          How the related items should be loaded.  Default value is
          ``select``.  Values include:

          * ``select`` - items should be loaded lazily when the property is
            first accessed, using a separate SELECT statement, or identity map
            fetch for simple many-to-one references.

          * ``immediate`` - items should be loaded as the parents are loaded,
            using a separate SELECT statement, or identity map fetch for
            simple many-to-one references.

          * ``joined`` - items should be loaded "eagerly" in the same query as
            that of the parent, using a JOIN or LEFT OUTER JOIN.  Whether
            the join is "outer" or not is determined by the
            :paramref:`_orm.relationship.innerjoin` parameter.

          * ``subquery`` - items should be loaded "eagerly" as the parents are
            loaded, using one additional SQL statement, which issues a JOIN to
            a subquery of the original statement, for each collection
            requested.

          * ``selectin`` - items should be loaded "eagerly" as the parents
            are loaded, using one or more additional SQL statements, which
            issues a JOIN to the immediate parent object, specifying primary
            key identifiers using an IN clause.

            .. versionadded:: 1.2

          * ``noload`` - no loading should occur at any time.  This is to
            support "write-only" attributes, or attributes which are
            populated in some manner specific to the application.

          * ``raise`` - lazy loading is disallowed; accessing
            the attribute, if its value were not already loaded via eager
            loading, will raise an :exc:`~sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError`.
            This strategy can be used when objects are to be detached from
            their attached :class:`.Session` after they are loaded.

            .. versionadded:: 1.1

          * ``raise_on_sql`` - lazy loading that emits SQL is disallowed;
            accessing the attribute, if its value were not already loaded via
            eager loading, will raise an
            :exc:`~sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError`, **if the lazy load
            needs to emit SQL**.  If the lazy load can pull the related value
            from the identity map or determine that it should be None, the
            value is loaded.  This strategy can be used when objects will
            remain associated with the attached :class:`.Session`, however
            additional SELECT statements should be blocked.

            .. versionadded:: 1.1

          * ``dynamic`` - the attribute will return a pre-configured
            :class:`_query.Query` object for all read
            operations, onto which further filtering operations can be
            applied before iterating the results.  See
            the section :ref:`dynamic_relationship` for more details.

        :param load_on_pending=False:
          Indicates loading behavior for transient or pending parent objects.

          When set to ``True``, causes the lazy-loader to
          issue a query for a parent object that is not persistent, meaning it
          has never been flushed.  This may take effect for a pending object
          when autoflush is disabled, or for a transient object that has been
          "attached" to a :class:`.Session` but is not part of its pending
          collection.

          The :paramref:`_orm.relationship.load_on_pending`
          flag does not improve
          behavior when the ORM is used normally - object references should be
          constructed at the object level, not at the foreign key level, so
          that they are present in an ordinary way before a flush proceeds.
          This flag is not not intended for general use.

          .. seealso::

              :meth:`.Session.enable_relationship_loading` - this method
              establishes "load on pending" behavior for the whole object, and
              also allows loading on objects that remain transient or
              detached.

        :param order_by:
          Indicates the ordering that should be applied when loading these
          items.  :paramref:`_orm.relationship.order_by`
          is expected to refer to
          one of the :class:`_schema.Column`
          objects to which the target class is
          mapped, or the attribute itself bound to the target class which
          refers to the column.

          :paramref:`_orm.relationship.order_by`
          may also be passed as a callable
          function which is evaluated at mapper initialization time, and may
          be passed as a Python-evaluable string when using Declarative.

          .. warning:: When passed as a Python-evaluable string, the
             argument is interpreted using Python's ``eval()`` function.
             **DO NOT PASS UNTRUSTED INPUT TO THIS STRING**.
             See :ref:`declarative_relationship_eval` for details on
             declarative evaluation of :func:`_orm.relationship` arguments.

        :param passive_deletes=False:
           Indicates loading behavior during delete operations.

           A value of True indicates that unloaded child items should not
           be loaded during a delete operation on the parent.  Normally,
           when a parent item is deleted, all child items are loaded so
           that they can either be marked as deleted, or have their
           foreign key to the parent set to NULL.  Marking this flag as
           True usually implies an ON DELETE <CASCADE|SET NULL> rule is in
           place which will handle updating/deleting child rows on the
           database side.

           Additionally, setting the flag to the string value 'all' will
           disable the "nulling out" of the child foreign keys, when the parent
           object is deleted and there is no delete or delete-orphan cascade
           enabled.  This is typically used when a triggering or error raise
           scenario is in place on the database side.  Note that the foreign
           key attributes on in-session child objects will not be changed after
           a flush occurs so this is a very special use-case setting.
           Additionally, the "nulling out" will still occur if the child
           object is de-associated with the parent.

           .. seealso::

                :ref:`passive_deletes` - Introductory documentation
                and examples.

        :param passive_updates=True:
          Indicates the persistence behavior to take when a referenced
          primary key value changes in place, indicating that the referencing
          foreign key columns will also need their value changed.

          When True, it is assumed that ``ON UPDATE CASCADE`` is configured on
          the foreign key in the database, and that the database will
          handle propagation of an UPDATE from a source column to
          dependent rows.  When False, the SQLAlchemy
          :func:`_orm.relationship`
          construct will attempt to emit its own UPDATE statements to
          modify related targets.  However note that SQLAlchemy **cannot**
          emit an UPDATE for more than one level of cascade.  Also,
          setting this flag to False is not compatible in the case where
          the database is in fact enforcing referential integrity, unless
          those constraints are explicitly "deferred", if the target backend
          supports it.

          It is highly advised that an application which is employing
          mutable primary keys keeps ``passive_updates`` set to True,
          and instead uses the referential integrity features of the database
          itself in order to handle the change efficiently and fully.

          .. seealso::

              :ref:`passive_updates` - Introductory documentation and
              examples.

              :paramref:`.mapper.passive_updates` - a similar flag which
              takes effect for joined-table inheritance mappings.

        :param post_update:
          This indicates that the relationship should be handled by a
          second UPDATE statement after an INSERT or before a
          DELETE. Currently, it also will issue an UPDATE after the
          instance was UPDATEd as well, although this technically should
          be improved. This flag is used to handle saving bi-directional
          dependencies between two individual rows (i.e. each row
          references the other), where it would otherwise be impossible to
          INSERT or DELETE both rows fully since one row exists before the
          other. Use this flag when a particular mapping arrangement will
          incur two rows that are dependent on each other, such as a table
          that has a one-to-many relationship to a set of child rows, and
          also has a column that references a single child row within that
          list (i.e. both tables contain a foreign key to each other). If
          a flush operation returns an error that a "cyclical
          dependency" was detected, this is a cue that you might want to
          use :paramref:`_orm.relationship.post_update` to "break" the cycle.

              :ref:`post_update` - Introductory documentation and examples.

        :param primaryjoin:
          A SQL expression that will be used as the primary
          join of the child object against the parent object, or in a
          many-to-many relationship the join of the parent object to the
          association table. By default, this value is computed based on the
          foreign key relationships of the parent and child tables (or
          association table).

        :param secondaryjoin:
          A SQL expression that will be used as the join of

          computed based on the foreign key relationships of the association
          and child tables.

          are many-to-one or many-to-many and also
          specify the ``delete-orphan`` cascade option.  The

        :param uselist:
          A boolean that indicates if this property should be loaded as a
          list or a scalar. In most cases, this value is determined
          automatically by :func:`_orm.relationship` at mapper configuration
          time, based on the type and direction
          of the relationship - one to many forms a list, many to one
          forms a scalar, many to many is a list. If a scalar is desired
          where normally a list would be present, such as a bi-directional
          one-to-one relationship, set :paramref:`_orm.relationship.uselist`
          to
          False.

              :paramref:`_orm.relationship.uselist` flag is needed.

        :param viewonly=False:
          When set to ``True``, the relationship is used only for loading
          objects, and not for any persistence operation.  A
          :func:`_orm.relationship` which specifies
          :paramref:`_orm.relationship.viewonly` can work
          with a wider range of SQL operations within the
          :paramref:`_orm.relationship.primaryjoin` condition, including
          operations that feature the use of a variety of comparison operators
          as well as SQL functions such as :func:`_expression.cast`.  The
          :paramref:`_orm.relationship.viewonly`
          flag is also of general use when defining any kind of
          :func:`_orm.relationship` that doesn't represent
          the full set of related objects, to prevent modifications of the
          collection from resulting in persistence operations.

          When using the :paramref:`_orm.relationship.viewonly` flag in
          conjunction with backrefs, the originating relationship for a
          particular state change will not produce state changes within the
          viewonly relationship.   This is the behavior implied by
          :paramref:`_orm.relationship.sync_backref` being set to False.

          .. versionchanged:: 1.3.17 - the
             :paramref:`_orm.relationship.sync_backref` flag is set to False

          Defaults to ``None``, which indicates that an automatic value should
          be selected based on the value of the

                AND my_association_table_1.child_id = <some id>

            Where ``<some id>`` would be the primary key of
            ``other``. From the above, it is clear that
            :meth:`~.RelationshipProperty.Comparator.contains`
            will **not** work with many-to-many collections when
            used in queries that move beyond simple AND
            conjunctions, such as multiple

            expressions joined by OR. In such cases subqueries or
            explicit "outer joins" will need to be used instead.
