from .. import event
from .base import SchemaEventTarget


class DDLEvents(event.Events):
    """
    Define event listeners for schema objects,
    that is, :class:`.SchemaItem` and other :class:`.SchemaEventTarget`
    subclasses, including :class:`_schema.MetaData`, :class:`_schema.Table`,
    :class:`_schema.Column`.

    :class:`_schema.MetaData` and :class:`_schema.Table` support events
    specifically regarding when CREATE and DROP
    DDL is emitted to the database.

    Attachment events are also provided to customize
    behavior whenever a child schema element is associated
    with a parent, such as, when a :class:`_schema.Column` is associated
    with its :class:`_schema.Table`, when a
    :class:`_schema.ForeignKeyConstraint`
    is associated with a :class:`_schema.Table`, etc.

    Example using the ``after_create`` event::

        from sqlalchemy import event
        from sqlalchemy import Table, Column, Metadata, Integer

        m = MetaData()
        some_table = Table('some_table', m, Column('data', Integer))

        def after_create(target, connection, **kw):
            connection.execute(text(
                "ALTER TABLE %s SET name=foo_%s" % (target.name, target.name)
            ))

        event.listen(some_table, "after_create", after_create)

    DDL events integrate closely with the
    :class:`.DDL` class and the :class:`.DDLElement` hierarchy
    of DDL clause constructs, which are themselves appropriate
    as listener callables::

        from sqlalchemy import DDL
        event.listen(
            some_table,
            "after_create",
            DDL("ALTER TABLE %(table)s SET name=foo_%(table)s")
        )

    The methods here define the name of an event as well
    as the names of members that are passed to listener
    functions.

    For all :class:`.DDLEvent` events, the ``propagate=True`` keyword argument
    will ensure that a given event handler is propagated to copies of the
    object, which are made when using the :meth:`_schema.Table.to_metadata`
    method::

        from sqlalchemy import DDL
        event.listen(
            some_table,
            "after_create",
            DDL("ALTER TABLE %(table)s SET name=foo_%(table)s"),
            propagate=True
        )

        new_table = some_table.to_metadata(new_metadata)

    The above :class:`.DDL` object will also be associated with the
    :class:`_schema.Table` object represented by ``new_table``.

        .. versionadded:: 1.4.0b2 The :meth:`_events.DDLEvents.column_reflect`
           hook may now be applied to a :class:`_schema.MetaData` object as
           well as the :class:`_schema.MetaData` class itself where it will
           take place for all :class:`_schema.Table` objects associated with
           the targeted :class:`_schema.MetaData`.

        It may also be applied to the :class:`_schema.Table` class across
        the board::

            from sqlalchemy import Table

            @event.listens_for(Table, 'column_reflect')
            def receive_column_reflect(inspector, table, column_info):
                # receives for all Table objects that are reflected

        It can also be applied to a specific :class:`_schema.Table` at the
        point that one is being reflected using the
        :paramref:`_schema.Table.listeners` parameter::

            t1 = Table(
                "my_table",
                autoload_with=some_engine,
                listeners=[
                    ('column_reflect', receive_column_reflect)
                ]
            )

        The dictionary of column information as returned by the
        dialect is passed, and can be modified.  The dictionary
        is that returned in each element of the list returned
        by :meth:`.reflection.Inspector.get_columns`:

            * ``name`` - the column's name, is applied to the
              :paramref:`_schema.Column.name` parameter

            * ``type`` - the type of this column, which should be an instance
              of :class:`~sqlalchemy.types.TypeEngine`, is applied to the
              :paramref:`_schema.Column.type` parameter

            * ``nullable`` - boolean flag if the column is NULL or NOT NULL,
              is applied to the :paramref:`_schema.Column.nullable` parameter

            * ``default`` - the column's server default value.  This is
              normally specified as a plain string SQL expression, however the
              event can pass a :class:`.FetchedValue`, :class:`.DefaultClause`,
              or :func:`_expression.text` object as well.  Is applied to the
              :paramref:`_schema.Column.server_default` parameter

        The event is called before any action is taken against
        this dictionary, and the contents can be modified; the following
        additional keys may be added to the dictionary to further modify
        how the :class:`_schema.Column` is constructed:


            * ``key`` - the string key that will be used to access this
              :class:`_schema.Column` in the ``.c`` collection; will be applied
              to the :paramref:`_schema.Column.key` parameter. Is also used
              for ORM mapping.  See the section
              :ref:`mapper_automated_reflection_schemes` for an example.

            * ``quote`` - force or un-force quoting on the column name;
              is applied to the :paramref:`_schema.Column.quote` parameter.

            * ``info`` - a dictionary of arbitrary data to follow along with
              the :class:`_schema.Column`, is applied to the
              :paramref:`_schema.Column.info` parameter.

        :func:`.event.listen` also accepts the ``propagate=True``
        modifier for this event; when True, the listener function will
        be established for any copies made of the target object,
        i.e. those copies that are generated when
        :meth:`_schema.Table.to_metadata` is used.
