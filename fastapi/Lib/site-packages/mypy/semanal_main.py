"""Top-level logic for the semantic analyzer.

The semantic analyzer binds names, resolves imports, detects various
special constructs that don't have dedicated AST nodes after parse
(such as 'cast' which looks like a call), populates symbol tables, and
performs various simple consistency checks.

Semantic analysis of each SCC (strongly connected component; import
cycle) is performed in one unit. Each module is analyzed as multiple
separate *targets*; the module top level is one target and each function
is a target. Nested functions are not separate targets, however. This is
mostly identical to targets used by mypy daemon (but classes aren't
targets in semantic analysis).

We first analyze each module top level in an SCC. If we encounter some
names that we can't bind because the target of the name may not have
been processed yet, we *defer* the current target for further
processing. Deferred targets will be analyzed additional times until
everything can be bound, or we reach a maximum number of iterations.

We keep track of a set of incomplete namespaces, i.e. namespaces that we
haven't finished populating yet. References to these namespaces cause a
deferral if they can't be satisfied. Initially every module in the SCC
will be incomplete.
