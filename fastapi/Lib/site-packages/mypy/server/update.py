"""Update build by processing changes using fine-grained dependencies.

Use fine-grained dependencies to update targets in other modules that
may be affected by externally-visible changes in the changed modules.

This forms the core of the fine-grained incremental daemon mode. This
module is not used at all by the 'classic' (non-daemon) incremental
mode.

Here is some motivation for this mode:

* By keeping program state in memory between incremental runs, we
  only have to process changed modules, not their dependencies. The
  classic incremental mode has to deserialize the symbol tables of
  all dependencies of changed modules, which can be slow for large
  programs.

* Fine-grained dependencies allow processing only the relevant parts
  of modules indirectly affected by a change. Say, if only one function
  in a large module is affected by a change in another module, only this
  function is processed. The classic incremental mode always processes
  an entire file as a unit, which is typically much slower.

* It's possible to independently process individual modules within an
  import cycle (SCC). Small incremental changes can be fast independent
  of the size of the related SCC. In classic incremental mode, any change
  within a SCC requires the entire SCC to be processed, which can slow
  things down considerably.

Some terms:

* A *target* is a function/method definition or the top level of a module.
  We refer to targets using their fully qualified name (e.g.
  'mod.Cls.method'). Targets are the smallest units of processing during
  fine-grained incremental checking.

* A *trigger* represents the properties of a part of a program, and it
  gets triggered/fired when these properties change. For example,
  '<mod.func>' refers to a module-level function. It gets triggered if
  the signature of the function changes, or if the function is removed,
  for example.

Some program state is maintained across multiple build increments in
memory:

* The full ASTs of all modules are stored in memory all the time (this
  includes the type map).

* A fine-grained dependency map is maintained, which maps triggers to
  affected program locations (these can be targets, triggers, or
  classes). The latter determine what other parts of a program need to
  be processed again due to a fired trigger.

Here's a summary of how a fine-grained incremental program update happens:

* Determine which modules have changes in their source code since the
  previous update.

* Process changed modules one at a time. Perform a separate full update
  for each changed module, but only report the errors after all modules
  have been processed, since the intermediate states can generate bogus
  errors due to only seeing a partial set of changes.

* Each changed module is processed in full. We parse the module, and
  run semantic analysis to create a new AST and symbol table for the
  module. Reuse the existing ASTs and symbol tables of modules that
  have no changes in their source code. At the end of this stage, we have
  two ASTs and symbol tables for the changed module (the old and the new
  versions). The latter AST has not yet been type checked.

* Take a snapshot of the old symbol table. This is used later to determine
  which properties of the module have changed and which triggers to fire.

* Merge the old AST with the new AST, preserving the identities of
  externally visible AST nodes for which we can find a corresponding node
  in the new AST. (Look at mypy.server.astmerge for the details.) This
  way all external references to AST nodes in the changed module will
  continue to point to the right nodes (assuming they still have a valid
  target).

* Type check the new module.

* Take another snapshot of the symbol table of the changed module.
  Look at the differences between the old and new snapshots to determine
  which parts of the changed modules have changed. The result is a set of
  fired triggers.

* Using the dependency map and the fired triggers, decide which other
  targets have become stale and need to be reprocessed.

* Create new fine-grained dependencies for the changed module. We don't
  garbage collect old dependencies, since extra dependencies are relatively
  harmless (they take some memory and can theoretically slow things down
  a bit by causing redundant work). This is implemented in
  mypy.server.deps.

* Strip the stale AST nodes that we found above. This returns them to a
  state resembling the end of semantic analysis pass 1. We'll run semantic
  analysis again on the existing AST nodes, and since semantic analysis
  is not idempotent, we need to revert some changes made during semantic
  analysis. This is implemented in mypy.server.aststrip.

* Run semantic analyzer passes 2 and 3 on the stale AST nodes, and type
  check them. We also need to do the symbol table snapshot comparison
  dance to find any changes, and we need to merge ASTs to preserve AST node
  identities.

* If some triggers haven been fired, continue processing and repeat the
  previous steps until no triggers are fired.

This is module is tested using end-to-end fine-grained incremental mode
test cases (test-data/unit/fine-grained*.test).
