    """Analyze reachability of blocks and imports and other local things.

    This runs before semantic analysis, so names have not been bound. Imports are
    also not resolved yet, so we can only access the current module.

    This determines static reachability of blocks and imports due to version and
    platform checks, among others.

    The main entry point is 'visit_file'.

    Reachability of imports needs to be determined very early in the build since
    this affects which modules will ultimately be processed.

    Consider this example:

      import sys

      def do_stuff():
          # type: () -> None:
          if sys.python_version < (3,):
              import xyz  # Only available in Python 2
              xyz.whatever()
          ...

    The block containing 'import xyz' is unreachable in Python 3 mode. The import
    shouldn't be processed in Python 3 mode, even if the module happens to exist.
