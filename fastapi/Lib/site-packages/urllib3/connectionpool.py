        Port used for this HTTP Connection (None is equivalent to 80), passed
        into :class:`http.client.HTTPConnection`.

    :param timeout:
        Socket timeout in seconds for each individual connection. This can
        be a float or integer, which sets the timeout for the HTTP request,
        or an instance of :class:`urllib3.util.Timeout` which gives you more
        fine-grained control over request timeouts. After the constructor has
        been parsed, this is always a `urllib3.util.Timeout` object.

        Number of connections to save that can be reused. More than 1 is useful
        in multithreaded situations. If ``block`` is set to False, more
        connections will be created but they will not be saved once they've
        been used.

        If set to True, no more than ``maxsize`` connections will be used at
        a time. When no free connections are available, the call will block
        until a connection has been released. This is a useful side effect for
        particular multithreaded situations where one does not want to use more
        than maxsize connections per host to prevent flooding.

    :param headers:
        Headers to include with all requests, unless other headers are given
        explicitly.

    :param retries:
        Retry configuration to use by default with requests in this pool.

        Get a connection from the pool and perform an HTTP request. This is the
        lowest level call for making a request, so you'll need to specify all
        the raw details.

        .. note::

           More commonly, it's appropriate to use a convenience method
           such as :meth:`request`.

        .. note::

           `release_conn` will only behave as expected if
           `preload_content=False` because we want to make
           `preload_content=False` the default behaviour someday soon without
           breaking backwards compatibility.

        :param method:
            HTTP request method (such as GET, POST, PUT, etc.)

        :param url:
            The URL to perform the request on.

        :param body:
            Data to send in the request body, either :class:`str`, :class:`bytes`,
            an iterable of :class:`str`/:class:`bytes`, or a file-like object.

        :param headers:
            Dictionary of custom headers to send, such as User-Agent,
            If-None-Match, etc. If None, pool headers are used. If provided,
            these headers completely replace any pool-specific headers.

        :param retries:
            Configure the number of retries to allow before raising a
            :class:`~urllib3.exceptions.MaxRetryError` exception.

            Pass ``None`` to retry until you receive a response. Pass a
            :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry` object for fine-grained control
            over different types of retries.
            Pass an integer number to retry connection errors that many times,
            but no other types of errors. Pass zero to never retry.

            If ``False``, then retries are disabled and any exception is raised
            immediately. Also, instead of raising a MaxRetryError on redirects,
            the redirect response will be returned.

        :type retries: :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry`, False, or an int.

        :param redirect:
            If True, automatically handle redirects (status codes 301, 302,
            303, 307, 308). Each redirect counts as a retry. Disabling retries
            will disable redirect, too.

        :param assert_same_host:
            If ``True``, will make sure that the host of the pool requests is
            consistent else will raise HostChangedError. When ``False``, you can
            use the pool on an HTTP proxy and request foreign hosts.

        :param timeout:
            If specified, overrides the default timeout for this one
            request. It may be a float (in seconds) or an instance of
            :class:`urllib3.util.Timeout`.

        :param pool_timeout:
            If set and the pool is set to block=True, then this method will
            block for ``pool_timeout`` seconds and raise EmptyPoolError if no
            connection is available within the time period.

        :param bool preload_content:
            If True, the response's body will be preloaded into memory.

        :param bool decode_content:
            If True, will attempt to decode the body based on the
            'content-encoding' header.

        :param release_conn:
            If False, then the urlopen call will not release the connection
            back into the pool once a response is received (but will release if
            you read the entire contents of the response such as when
            `preload_content=True`). This is useful if you're not preloading
            the response's content immediately. You will need to call
            ``r.release_conn()`` on the response ``r`` to return the connection
            back into the pool. If None, it takes the value of ``preload_content``
            which defaults to ``True``.

        :param bool chunked:
            If True, urllib3 will send the body using chunked transfer
            encoding. Otherwise, urllib3 will send the body using the standard
            content-length form. Defaults to False.

        :param int body_pos:
            Position to seek to in file-like body in the event of a retry or
            redirect. Typically this won't need to be set because urllib3 will
            auto-populate the value when needed.
