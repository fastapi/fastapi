    """Timeout configuration.

    Timeouts can be defined as a default for a pool:

    .. code-block:: python

        import urllib3

        timeout = urllib3.util.Timeout(connect=2.0, read=7.0)

        http = urllib3.PoolManager(timeout=timeout)

        resp = http.request("GET", "https://example.com/")

        print(resp.status)

    Or per-request (which overrides the default for the pool):

    .. code-block:: python

       response = http.request("GET", "https://example.com/", timeout=Timeout(10))

    Timeouts can be disabled by setting all the parameters to ``None``:

    .. code-block:: python

       no_timeout = Timeout(connect=None, read=None)
       response = http.request("GET", "https://example.com/", timeout=no_timeout)


    :param total:
        This combines the connect and read timeouts into one; the read timeout
        will be set to the time leftover from the connect attempt. In the
        event that both a connect timeout and a total are specified, or a read
        timeout and a total are specified, the shorter timeout will be applied.

        Defaults to None.

    :type total: int, float, or None

    :param connect:
        The maximum amount of time (in seconds) to wait for a connection
        attempt to a server to succeed. Omitting the parameter will default the
        connect timeout to the system default, probably `the global default
        timeout in socket.py
        <http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/603b4d593758/Lib/socket.py#l535>`_.
        None will set an infinite timeout for connection attempts.

    :type connect: int, float, or None

    :param read:
        The maximum amount of time (in seconds) to wait between consecutive
        read operations for a response from the server. Omitting the parameter
        will default the read timeout to the system default, probably `the
        global default timeout in socket.py
        <http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/603b4d593758/Lib/socket.py#l535>`_.
        None will set an infinite timeout.

    :type read: int, float, or None

    .. note::

        Many factors can affect the total amount of time for urllib3 to return
        an HTTP response.

        For example, Python's DNS resolver does not obey the timeout specified
        on the socket. Other factors that can affect total request time include
        high CPU load, high swap, the program running at a low priority level,
        or other behaviors.

        In addition, the read and total timeouts only measure the time between
        read operations on the socket connecting the client and the server,
        not the total amount of time for the request to return a complete
        response. For most requests, the timeout is raised because the server
        has not sent the first byte in the specified time. This is not always
        the case; if a server streams one byte every fifteen seconds, a timeout
        of 20 seconds will not trigger, even though the request will take
        several minutes to complete.

        If your goal is to cut off any request after a set amount of wall clock
        time, consider having a second "watcher" thread to cut off a slow
        request.
