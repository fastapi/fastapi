The `dateutil` module provides powerful extensions to
the standard `datetime` module, available in Python.

Installation
============
`dateutil` can be installed from PyPI using `pip` (note that the package name is
different from the importable name)::

    pip install python-dateutil

Download
========
dateutil is available on PyPI
https://pypi.org/project/python-dateutil/

The documentation is hosted at:
https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

Code
====
The code and issue tracker are hosted on GitHub:
https://github.com/dateutil/dateutil/

Features
========

* Computing of relative deltas (next month, next year,
  next Monday, last week of month, etc);
* Computing of relative deltas between two given
  date and/or datetime objects;
* Computing of dates based on very flexible recurrence rules,
  using a superset of the `iCalendar <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2445.txt>`_
  specification. Parsing of RFC strings is supported as well.
* Generic parsing of dates in almost any string format;
* Timezone (tzinfo) implementations for tzfile(5) format
  files (/etc/localtime, /usr/share/zoneinfo, etc), TZ
  environment string (in all known formats), iCalendar
  format files, given ranges (with help from relative deltas),
  local machine timezone, fixed offset timezone, UTC timezone,
  and Windows registry-based time zones.
* Internal up-to-date world timezone information based on
  Olson's database.
* Computing of Easter Sunday dates for any given year,
  using Western, Orthodox or Julian algorithms;
* A comprehensive test suite.

Quick example
=============
Here's a snapshot, just to give an idea about the power of the
package. For more examples, look at the documentation.

Suppose you want to know how much time is left, in
years/months/days/etc, before the next easter happening on a
year with a Friday 13th in August, and you want to get today's
date out of the "date" unix system command. Here is the code:

.. code-block:: python3

    >>> from dateutil.relativedelta import *
    >>> from dateutil.easter import *
    >>> from dateutil.rrule import *
    >>> from dateutil.parser import *
    >>> from datetime import *
    >>> now = parse("Sat Oct 11 17:13:46 UTC 2003")
    >>> today = now.date()
    >>> year = rrule(YEARLY,dtstart=now,bymonth=8,bymonthday=13,byweekday=FR)[0].year
    >>> rdelta = relativedelta(easter(year), today)
    >>> print("Today is: %s" % today)
    Today is: 2003-10-11
    >>> print("Year with next Aug 13th on a Friday is: %s" % year)
    Year with next Aug 13th on a Friday is: 2004
    >>> print("How far is the Easter of that year: %s" % rdelta)
    How far is the Easter of that year: relativedelta(months=+6)
    >>> print("And the Easter of that year is: %s" % (today+rdelta))
    And the Easter of that year is: 2004-04-11

Being exactly 6 months ahead was **really** a coincidence :)

Starting with version 2.4.1 and running until 2.8.2, all source and binary
distributions will be signed by a PGP key that has, at the very least, been
signed by the key which made the previous release. A table of release signing
keys can be found below:

===========  ============================

New releases *may* have signed tags, but binary and source distributions
uploaded to PyPI will no longer have GPG signatures attached.
