Passlib is a password hashing library for Python 2 & 3, which provides
cross-platform implementations of over 30 password hashing algorithms, as well
as a framework for managing existing password hashes. It's designed to be useful
for a wide range of tasks, from verifying a hash found in /etc/shadow, to
providing full-strength password hashing for multi-user applications.
