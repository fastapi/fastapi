    and you will get a response object which you can use to attach headers.

    If view looked like this and you want to add a new header::

        def index():

    code::

    The first argument can be a file path or a file-like object. Paths

    requires that the file is opened in binary mode, and is mostly

    intend. Use :func:`send_from_directory` to safely serve
    user-requested paths from within a directory.

    used, otherwise Werkzeug's built-in wrapper is used. Alternatively,
    if the HTTP server supports ``X-Sendfile``, configuring Flask with

    :param path_or_file: The path to the file to send, relative to the

        Alternatively, a file-like object opened in binary mode. Make

        provided, it will try to detect it from the file name.
    :param as_attachment: Indicate to a browser that it should offer to
        save the file instead of displaying it.
    :param download_name: The default name browsers will use when saving
        the file. Defaults to the passed file name.
    :param conditional: Enable conditional and range responses based on
        request headers. Requires passing a file path and ``environ``.
    :param etag: Calculate an ETag for the file, which requires passing
        a file path. Can also be a string to use instead.
    :param last_modified: The last modified time to send for the file,
        in seconds. If not provided, it will try to detect it from the
        file path.
    :param max_age: How long the client should cache the file, in
