        `should_trace` is a function, taking a file name and a frame, and
        returning a `coverage.FileDisposition object`.

        `check_include` is a function taking a file name and a frame. It returns
        a boolean: True if the file should be traced, False if not.

        `should_start_context` is a function taking a frame, and returning a
        string. If the frame should be the start of a new context, the string
        is the new context. If the frame should not be the start of a new
        context, return None.

        `file_mapper` is a function taking a filename, and returning a Unicode
        filename.  The result is the name that will be recorded in the data
        file.

        If `timid` is true, then a slower simpler trace function will be
        used.  This is important for some environments where manipulation of
        tracing functions make the faster more sophisticated trace function not
        operate properly.

        If `branch` is true, then branches will be measured.  This involves
        collecting data on which statements followed each other (arcs).  Use
        `get_arc_data` to get the arc data.

        `warn` is a warning function, taking a single string message argument
        and an optional slug argument which will be a string or None, to be
        used if a warning needs to be issued.

        `concurrency` is a list of strings indicating the concurrency libraries
        in use.  Valid values are "greenlet", "eventlet", "gevent", or "thread"
        (the default).  "thread" can be combined with one of the other three.
