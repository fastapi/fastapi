Werkzeug
========

*werkzeug* German noun: "tool". Etymology: *werk* ("work"), *zeug* ("stuff")

Werkzeug is a comprehensive `WSGI`_ web application library. It began as
a simple collection of various utilities for WSGI applications and has
become one of the most advanced WSGI utility libraries.

It includes:

-   An interactive debugger that allows inspecting stack traces and
    source code in the browser with an interactive interpreter for any
    frame in the stack.
-   A full-featured request object with objects to interact with
    headers, query args, form data, files, and cookies.
-   A response object that can wrap other WSGI applications and handle
    streaming data.
-   A routing system for matching URLs to endpoints and generating URLs
    for endpoints, with an extensible system for capturing variables
    from URLs.
-   HTTP utilities to handle entity tags, cache control, dates, user
    agents, cookies, files, and more.
-   A threaded WSGI server for use while developing applications
    locally.
-   A test client for simulating HTTP requests during testing without
    requiring running a server.

Werkzeug doesn't enforce any dependencies. It is up to the developer to
choose a template engine, database adapter, and even how to handle
requests. It can be used to build all sorts of end user applications
such as blogs, wikis, or bulletin boards.

`Flask`_ wraps Werkzeug, using it to handle the details of WSGI while
providing more structure and patterns for defining powerful
applications.
