ItsDangerous
============

... so better sign this

Various helpers to pass data to untrusted environments and to get it
back safe and sound. Data is cryptographically signed to ensure that a
token has not been tampered with.

It's possible to customize how data is serialized. Data is compressed as
needed. A timestamp can be added and verified automatically while
loading a token.


Installing
----------

Install and update using `pip`_:

.. code-block:: text

    pip install -U itsdangerous

.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/getting-started/


A Simple Example
----------------

Here's how you could generate a token for transmitting a user's id and
name between web requests.

.. code-block:: python

    from itsdangerous import URLSafeSerializer
    auth_s = URLSafeSerializer("secret key", "auth")
    token = auth_s.dumps({"id": 5, "name": "itsdangerous"})

    print(token)
    # eyJpZCI6NSwibmFtZSI6Iml0c2Rhbmdlcm91cyJ9.6YP6T0BaO67XP--9UzTrmurXSmg

    data = auth_s.loads(token)
    print(data["name"])
    # itsdangerous
