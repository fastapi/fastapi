class OAuth2PasswordRequestForm:
    """
    This is a dependency class to collect the `username` and `password` as form data
    for an OAuth2 password flow.

    The OAuth2 specification dictates that for a password flow the data should be
    collected using form data (instead of JSON) and that it should have the specific
    fields `username` and `password`.

    All the initialization parameters are extracted from the request.

    Read more about it in the
    [FastAPI docs for Simple OAuth2 with Password and Bearer](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/security/simple-oauth2/).

    ## Example

    ```python
    from typing import Annotated

    from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI
    from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordRequestForm

    app = FastAPI()


    @app.post("/login")
    def login(form_data: Annotated[OAuth2PasswordRequestForm, Depends()]):
        data = {}
        data["scopes"] = []
        for scope in form_data.scopes:
            data["scopes"].append(scope)
        if form_data.client_id:
            data["client_id"] = form_data.client_id
        if form_data.client_secret:
            data["client_secret"] = form_data.client_secret
        return data
    ```

    Note that for OAuth2 the scope `items:read` is a single scope in an opaque string.
    You could have custom internal logic to separate it by colon caracters (`:`) or
    similar, and get the two parts `items` and `read`. Many applications do that to
    group and organize permissions, you could do it as well in your application, just
    know that that it is application specific, it's not part of the specification.
